CANON
  - Statements are separated by [\n.]+
  - CAN HAS <module/"file">?
    - for inclusion/requirement
  - GIMMEH [(LINE|WORD|LETTAR)] <VAR> [OUTTA <filedesc>]
    - with default being LINE and STDIN
  - HAI
  - KTHXBYE
    - only closes HAI and exits with good condition
  - DIAF [<num> [<text>]]
    - Exits the program (failure)
    - Status code: <num>
    - Printed to stderr or equivalent: <text>
  - BYES [<num> [<text>]]
  - KTHX 
    - is the universal "closing bracket" line
    - for any if block, looping block, function, etc... except HAI
  - IM IN YR [<loop label>]
    - label has no effect
  - VISIBLE <stuff>[!]
    - prints stuff as minimally as possible and with a newline (unless !)
  - I HAS A <l_value> ITZ ...
    - Everything is an array.  muahahahaha.
    - By default, the variable has one element
    - ITZ ... has been tabled for future usage
  - [## IN MAH]* <var>
    - Since all variables are arrays, with no IN MAH it references the array
      as a whole.
    - Multiple occurences of this index sub-levels of the array.
      - 1 IN MAH 2 IN MAH arr <=> arr[2][1]
    - Does NOT expand the size of the array (except as l_value of assignment)
      - Throws error/dies on out of bounds?
  - LOL <var> R <val>
    - Assigns value into l_value specified by var.
    - Extends the size of var if necessary
    - If no index is specified, applies to all elements? (one by default)
  - IZ <cond> [?] [(.|\n) YARLY] (.|\n) <code> (.|\n) [NOWAI (.|\n) <code>] KTHX
    - Conditional syntax.  See examples.
  - Comparison operators: [NOT] ((BIGR|SMALR) THAN|LIEK)
    - See example and keywords:operators
  - Logical/Bitwise operators: (NOT|AND|OR|XOR)
    - See example and keywords:operators
  - Operators (all math, as of v1.0, is integer math)
    - a UP b        : a +
    - UPZ a!![b     : a += b (b=1)
    - a NERF b      : a - b
    - NERFZ a!![b]  : a -= b (b=1)
    - a TIEMZ b     : a * b
    - TIEMZD a!![b] : a *= b (b=1)
    - a OVAR b      : a / b
    - OVARZ a!![b]  : a /= b (b=1)
UNOFFICIAL
  - This stuff was not voted on explicitly but appears to be standard based on
    the examples and discussion during the meeting
  - BTW <comment>
    - Comment syntax.  Runs until end of line.
