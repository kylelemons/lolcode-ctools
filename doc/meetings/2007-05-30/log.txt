[May 30 18:01:22] <@lolcode_com> huh?
[May 30 18:01:34] <@lolcode_com> I was just reading up on voting. :)
[May 30 18:01:39] <@Eko> you asked to have your piece at the beginning ;)

[May 30 18:05:13] <+aarcane> lolcode_com, it is for now, but a mailing list should be set up in the future.
[May 30 18:05:20] <@lolcode_com> cos I could set up something like a PunBB forum.lolcode.com
[May 30 18:05:26] <@lolcode_com> fairly easily.
[May 30 18:05:31] <+Tetraboy> I like the idea of a forum.
[May 30 18:05:32] <burn-out> it works for heart monitor software deving for me
[May 30 18:05:33] <UnLogikal> lolcode_com: that you adam?
[May 30 18:05:36] <@Eko> mailing lists will be available on sourceforge, correct?
[May 30 18:05:36] <+aarcane> lolcode_com, a forum works well.
[May 30 18:05:44] <@Eko> but forums are awesome
[May 30 18:05:55] <@Eko> especially phpbb, with voting =)
[May 30 18:05:58] <@lolcode_com> I was trying to catch up with the contributions, and it's a bit chaotic to follow discussion on a wiki.
[May 30 18:06:01] <@lolcode_com> (hi kyle)
[May 30 18:06:05] <faceninja> irc is good for discussion, forums are especially useful when you have code snippets or something longer than a line or two
[May 30 18:06:07] <faceninja> both is best
[May 30 18:06:12] <UnLogikal> you seem to have quite the following ;) lol
[May 30 18:06:16] <@lolcode_com> ok. I'll get working on that.
[May 30 18:06:25] <@Eko> very true faceninja
[May 30 18:06:27] <+aarcane> IRC will always be here
[May 30 18:06:34] <extrabyte> but wiki is good for capturing consensus (Better than forum)
[May 30 18:06:40] <extrabyte> are we off topic yet?
[May 30 18:06:45] <@Eko> haha
[May 30 18:06:45] <@lolcode_com> abosolutely, for consensus.
[May 30 18:06:48] <@Eko> yeah
[May 30 18:06:54] <extrabyte> thought so
[May 30 18:07:04] <@Eko> I'll be putting (hopefully with help!) our consensus under the keywords section on the wiki
[May 30 18:07:04] <+aarcane> extrabyte, forums with a vote feature are very good for catching consensus
[May 30 18:07:18] <SimonRC> we should be +m by now
[May 30 18:07:24] <extrabyte> sounds good, Eko
[May 30 18:07:26] <+Tetraboy> So far the wiki is being used as a forum.
[May 30 18:07:33] <@lolcode_com> yeah.
[May 30 18:07:35] <@Eko> okay, does everyone who needs voice have it?
[May 30 18:07:39] <+Tetraboy> With people posting ideas, adding comments.
[May 30 18:07:46] <@Eko> remember you can vote without it and discuss in #LOLCODE
[May 30 18:07:49] <@lolcode_com> Also, wanted to apologise for the ~20 hours of lockdown.
[May 30 18:07:50] <+Jessicatz> I HAS A VOICE
[May 30 18:07:59] <@lolcode_com> Digg is a powerful thing.
[May 30 18:08:01] <@Eko> hilight someone with voice in #LOLCODE if you want to get their attention.
[May 30 18:08:12] <+Ihoss> you were high on delicious too
[May 30 18:08:16] <@Eko> any more voices?
[May 30 18:08:17] <@lolcode_com> but the server never really died.
[May 30 18:08:34] <+Tetraboy> I got alot of hits from stumbleupon, dunno who submitted it.
[May 30 18:08:48] <@Eko> okay guys, here we go.

[May 30 18:08:50] <@lolcode_com> oh, traffic's now coming in from everywhere, but digg did the real damage.
[May 30 18:09:18] <@lolcode_com> wow. that made a difference.
[May 30 18:09:18] <+viraptor> you were popular on dailyWTF also :)
[May 30 18:09:21] <@Eko> you guys ready to dive into spec?
[May 30 18:09:28] <+johan-s> HAI
[May 30 18:09:30] <@Eko> viraptor, we made it there? rofl
[May 30 18:09:35] <+aarcane> K
[May 30 18:09:43] <@Eko> okay, first order of business.
[May 30 18:09:47] <@lolcode_com> That's pretty much all I wanted to cover up front. If I'm around later,
[May 30 18:09:51] <@Eko> CAN HAS
[May 30 18:10:01] <@lolcode_com> I'll fit into AOB.
[May 30 18:10:05] <@lolcode_com> KTHX
[May 30 18:10:06] <@Eko> lol
[May 30 18:10:18] <@Eko> We've seen it as "CAN HAS <lib>?" and without the ?
[May 30 18:10:41] <@Eko> there has been discussion on whether this is a suggestion or a requirement to run.
[May 30 18:10:44] <+aarcane> CAN HAS <lib>? should be an include, without the ? should be a require I think
[May 30 18:10:50] <@Eko> I agree
[May 30 18:10:59] <@Eko> but what about including files?
[May 30 18:11:00] <+Tetraboy> I think MUST HAS <lib> for require
[May 30 18:11:22] <+aarcane> same as other languages, CAN HAS "file"
[May 30 18:11:30] <+viraptor> can has stdio - lib vs. can has "file" ?
[May 30 18:11:30] <@Eko> Tetraboy, the only problem I see with that is lolcat precedence
[May 30 18:11:47] <@Eko> there isn't much
[May 30 18:11:52] * joele23 has quit (Remote closed the connection)
[May 30 18:11:55] <@Eko> and it makes more work for the interpreter/parser
[May 30 18:12:19] <+Tetraboy> CAN HAS <lib>? for include
[May 30 18:12:22] <@lolcode_com> not a whole lot of work, eh?
[May 30 18:12:44] <+aarcane> I like CAN HAS and CAN HAS ?.
[May 30 18:12:45] * shachaf (n=shachaf@66.17.178.31) has joined ##lolcode
[May 30 18:12:49] <+Tetraboy> but I could live with the ? making include.
[May 30 18:12:51] <+johan-s> none of that php require/include crap I say
[May 30 18:12:58] <+johan-s> just one, or fail
[May 30 18:13:25] <@Eko> so, I move that we vote... keep the "CAN HAS" wording (with ? or without)
[May 30 18:13:26] <+Ihoss> yeah, i don't see the reason for having both requirer and include
[May 30 18:13:27] <+johan-s> if not found
[May 30 18:13:33] <+Ihoss> requirer once is more important
[May 30 18:13:35] <+viraptor> yes - we can't check later if a function exists, so let's just skip include (not require)
[May 30 18:13:38] <@Eko> then we can talk about ? and stuff
[May 30 18:13:48] <@Eko> do I have a second?
[May 30 18:13:50] <+Ihoss> keep the ?
[May 30 18:14:07] <@Eko> well anyway
[May 30 18:14:15] <+aarcane> Mmm, they make a good point, I'm swayed to no require, just CAN HAS, but I think it should return a value

[May 30 18:18:25] <+Tetraboy> Could be useful, and why not?
[May 30 18:18:33] <+Jessicatz> what use could CAN HAS have?
[May 30 18:18:39] <+KrazyJim> Isn't require and include a little overcomplicated?
[May 30 18:18:44] <@Eko> Jessicatz, including another LOLCODE file
[May 30 18:18:53] <@Eko> with someone else's functions or (later) classes
[May 30 18:18:57] <+johan-s> think it should just raise some kind of exception if no such file
[May 30 18:18:59] <@Eko> or external modules or whatever
[May 30 18:19:02] <+Jessicatz> okay...
[May 30 18:19:03] <+KrazyJim> just require would mean there's no need to test for success, just have the compiler/interpreter die on failure
[May 30 18:19:42] <@Eko> I move we vote for return/throw an error or die on error
[May 30 18:19:53] <@lolcode_com> seconded

[May 30 18:19:59] <+Tetraboy> wait

[May 30 18:28:52] <@Eko> eh
[May 30 18:29:01] <@Eko> I think GIMMEH should input a single word
[May 30 18:29:07] <+Tetraboy> how about GIMMEH() being FREAD()
[May 30 18:29:09] <@Eko> and convert it into whatever datatype it is given
[May 30 18:29:24] <+johan-s> Eko: nice and simple, I like
[May 30 18:29:29] <+viraptor> or line? like typical gets(), or ReadLine()
[May 30 18:29:31] <@Eko> Tetraboy, transcoding can include a function to do whatever it wants
[May 30 18:29:31] <+Ihoss> GIMMEH could be single line
[May 30 18:29:38] <@Eko> I think it should be single word
[May 30 18:29:43] <@Eko> you could write your own function to get a line
[May 30 18:29:46] <@Eko> GIMMEHLINE
[May 30 18:29:52] <@Eko> or
[May 30 18:29:53] <+viraptor> :)
[May 30 18:29:55] <@Eko> we could have both of those
[May 30 18:30:01] <+aarcane> I think we can GIMMEH LINE <var> etc..
[May 30 18:30:04] <@Eko> but I think we need a word only construct for flexibility
[May 30 18:30:17] <@Eko> should it have the space?
[May 30 18:30:32] <+Ihoss> GIMMEH A LINE ?
[May 30 18:30:40] <@Eko> eh
[May 30 18:30:41] <@lolcode_com> sorry, what's the functional difference between a word and a line?
[May 30 18:30:51] <+viraptor> yeah... we're context based anyway, so it's either gimmeh line <var> or gimmeh <var>
[May 30 18:30:52] <+Ihoss> or we could use GIEF for that
[May 30 18:30:59] <@Eko> lolcode_com, a word is a more basic unit and can be converted into different datatypes
[May 30 18:31:02] <+aarcane> System Dependant Newlines
[May 30 18:31:14] <+Tetraboy> What is this reading from/for? I'm confusored.

[May 30 18:31:23] <+aarcane> Tetraboy, stdin
[May 30 18:31:30] <+viraptor> into a var
[May 30 18:31:54] <+Ihoss> I allways (the last 3 days) imagined it would be a command line program
[May 30 18:32:02] <@Eko> so, move to vote on line/var?
[May 30 18:32:04] <+Ihoss> that way GIMMEH would request a new line
[May 30 18:32:05] <@Eko> er

[May 30 18:32:12] <@Eko> if word succeeds, we can add GIMMEHLINE or something
[May 30 18:32:14] <@lolcode_com> if it's more than a word (space delimited), then you have a good idea of what type it is, too.
[May 30 18:32:15] <+Tetraboy> I'm more from the web side.
[May 30 18:32:22] <+aarcane> I think we need GIMME <LINE, WORD, CHAR> <var> FROM <file descriptor>
[May 30 18:32:40] <+KrazyJim> aarcane, i think that's the best option

[May 30 18:35:40] <+Ihoss> !no
[May 30 18:35:40] <+kYx-ng> Thank you, Ihoss, your vote of NO has been counted.
[May 30 18:35:45] <@Eko> actually
[May 30 18:35:47] <@Eko> hmm.
[May 30 18:35:53] <@Eko> !no
[May 30 18:35:53] <+kYx-ng> Thank you, Eko, your vote has been changed to NO.
[May 30 18:36:00] <+kYx-ng> The results are in!
[May 30 18:36:00] <+kYx-ng>   Keep "GIMMEH (LINE|WORD|LETTAR) <VAR> [OUTTA <filedesc>]" AS-IS? (no if you dislike anything at all)
[May 30 18:36:00] <+kYx-ng>   Yea: 4
[May 30 18:36:00] <+kYx-ng>   Nea: 5
[May 30 18:36:01] <+kYx-ng> The neas win!
[May 30 18:36:11] <@Eko> I think we need to pick one as a default first.
[May 30 18:36:21] <@lolcode_com> yup.
[May 30 18:36:23] <+Ihoss> I think reading from file should be a function, and so should be set up with function parameters
[May 30 18:36:24] <@Eko> and say that filedesc will be stdin by default if not specified.
[May 30 18:36:30] <@lolcode_com> yes.
[May 30 18:36:37] <+johan-s> GIMME <tba> ;)
[May 30 18:36:56] <+KrazyJim> I'd prefer it to read from command line if there's no file descriptor, if there is a file descriptor it needs to be opened first
[May 30 18:36:59] <@Eko> Ihoss, we havne't even gotten to functions yet
[May 30 18:37:03] <@Eko> this is really basic I/O
[May 30 18:37:07] <+Tetraboy> normally reading from files is a function
[May 30 18:37:08] <@Eko> more advanced IO can coexist
[May 30 18:37:13] <+Tetraboy> *normally being PHP
[May 30 18:37:14] <+Ihoss> I know, and I say we wait with reading from files
[May 30 18:37:27] <+johan-s> I think lollers should implement that kinda stuff themselves first
[May 30 18:37:39] <+johan-s> and then we can talk about bringing it into the fold
[May 30 18:37:40] <@Eko> Tetraboy, we're not going to make this transcode letter for letter into PHP
[May 30 18:37:43] <+Tetraboy> reading a file should be the function in STDIN
[May 30 18:37:52] <@Eko> this is probably the most flexible yet simple thing we can do.
[May 30 18:37:54] <@lolcode_com> STDIO
[May 30 18:37:56] <+johan-s> eg, super simple at first and see what functions people cook up
[May 30 18:38:06] <+Tetraboy> err, STDIO
[May 30 18:38:17] <@Eko> hence gimmeh line|word|lettar
[May 30 18:38:25] <@Eko> okay, I don't think anyone wants letter to be the default
[May 30 18:38:29] <@Eko> (right?)
[May 30 18:38:33] <+Tetraboy> no
[May 30 18:38:35] <+Ihoss> no
[May 30 18:38:35] <@Eko> so vote on line vs word?
[May 30 18:38:45] <+Tetraboy> I think we should leave gimmeh until we get to functions, anyone agree?
[May 30 18:38:49] <@lolcode_com> and what's the distinction?
[May 30 18:39:00] <+Ihoss> no whitespace?
[May 30 18:39:00] <@Eko> lolcode_com, line reads until [\r\n]+
[May 30 18:39:08] <@Eko> word reads until \s+
[May 30 18:39:16] <+Tetraboy> cause if we do file read, then we need file_write.
[May 30 18:39:29] <@Eko> we can have separate functions later
[May 30 18:39:32] <@Eko> that do advanced I/O
[May 30 18:39:34] <+Ihoss> agree with tetraboy
[May 30 18:39:36] <+Tetraboy> And all of those should be standardized into a function format.
[May 30 18:39:55] <@Eko> Tetraboy, does that preclude from having simple, easy I/O for variables?
[May 30 18:39:58] <@lolcode_com> but that's a but f'd up to have a callback (whatevs) on each space.
[May 30 18:40:02] <+Ihoss> the moment you start reading from files then you need to be able to explore the directory system too
[May 30 18:40:03] <+johan-s> vote on line vs /s+
[May 30 18:40:28] <@lolcode_com> seconded

[May 30 18:43:14] <@Eko> lol
[May 30 18:43:26] <@Eko> that won't be in v1.0 anyway, probably
[May 30 18:43:42] <@lolcode_com> depends how you count
[May 30 18:43:57] <@Eko> *shrug*
[May 30 18:44:01] <@Eko> I see this as being 1.0
[May 30 18:44:08] <@Eko> everything up to now was 0.*
[May 30 18:44:08] <+Ihoss> 0.1 :p
[May 30 18:44:10] <@lolcode_com> ok.
[May 30 18:44:21] <@lolcode_com> I'm a smart-ass, don't mind me.
[May 30 18:44:23] <@Eko> since there will be code based on this that will probably be released, I say it's a full version number.
[May 30 18:44:25] <+aarcane> Ihoss, you can re-write around it using functions later :)
[May 30 18:44:45] <@Eko> but anyway, that's recorded... next is
[May 30 18:44:49] <+Tetraboy> Ihoss, don't have to support specs you don't like.

[May 30 18:45:07] <+johan-s> (as a side note, lang features and closer to the metal stuff, not syntax would be a better start, but its not the lol way)

[May 30 18:45:20] <+aarcane> Eko, I think 0.9 pre should be the version, and then we should use 1.0 after it's been tested a while

[May 30 18:45:44] <+johan-s> HAI as C main() right?

[May 30 18:45:49] <+kYx-ng> The results are in!
[May 30 18:45:49] <+kYx-ng>   Keep HAI as-is?

[May 30 18:45:49] <+kYx-ng>   Nea: 0
[May 30 18:45:49] <+kYx-ng> The yeas win by a landslide!
[May 30 18:46:00] <@Eko> basically johan-s.
[May 30 18:46:08] <+Tetraboy> Or <?php
[May 30 18:46:13] <@Eko> okay, now I think KTHXBYE will pass
[May 30 18:46:14] <+johan-s> fuck that
[May 30 18:46:15] <@Eko> but one question:
[May 30 18:46:24] <+aarcane> johan-s, HAI as PHP <?PHP is more accurate.  but as C main() until we get functions.
[May 30 18:46:28] <@Eko> Should KTHXBYE be used only for closing the full program?
[May 30 18:46:36] <+Ihoss> yup
[May 30 18:46:40] <+KrazyJim> i think it makes sense to use it as an end character and break
[May 30 18:46:41] <+viraptor> yes - KTHXBYE = exit
[May 30 18:46:42] <+Tetraboy> closing the program block, asin ?>
[May 30 18:46:42] <@Eko> (i.e. not for returning from the middle of it
[May 30 18:46:45] <+Ihoss> kinda like return in a function
[May 30 18:46:53] <@Eko> I think KTHXBYE should match HAI
[May 30 18:46:58] <+johan-s> I absolutely hate that
[May 30 18:47:09] <+johan-s> no php template stuff plz
[May 30 18:47:13] <+viraptor> maybe KTHXBYE <foo> == exit(foo) ? (foo=0 by def.)
[May 30 18:47:18] <@Eko> and we should have something like DIAF to return with a bad status code and BYES or BBL to exit with a good status code
[May 30 18:47:18] <+Tetraboy> I don't think KTHXBYE should be exit.
[May 30 18:47:20] <+Ihoss> You should be able to call it anywhere and it stops the program
[May 30 18:47:29] <+aarcane> KTHX vs KTHXB.. I think KTHX should be like break or return, KTHXB.. should be exit, die, ?> etc.
[May 30 18:47:40] <@lolcode_com> stops the program, or breaks the current block?
[May 30 18:47:49] <@Eko> I think HAI needs a match
[May 30 18:47:54] <+Ihoss> agree with aarcane
[May 30 18:47:59] <+Ihoss> and eko
[May 30 18:48:06] <+KrazyJim> ditto
[May 30 18:48:06] <+Tetraboy> kthxbye: close HAI
[May 30 18:48:10] <@Eko> and having multiple KTHXBYEs is kinda weird to me
[May 30 18:48:17] <+Tetraboy> kthx: close function/if block
[May 30 18:48:27] <+Ihoss> eko, it adds flavour
[May 30 18:48:37] <+viraptor> eko: something else for DIE?
[May 30 18:48:40] <+Ihoss> lets you close the program in an if statement
[May 30 18:48:48] <+Tetraboy> Eko, for compiled programs I could see having just one HAI/KTHXBYE
[May 30 18:48:49] <@Eko> I suggest DIAF for bad and BYES or BBL For good
[May 30 18:48:57] <+Tetraboy> For internet, multiple ones are very useful.
[May 30 18:49:01] <@Eko> but they don't matter
[May 30 18:49:04] <@Eko> just that it's not KTHXBYE
[May 30 18:49:42] <+Ihoss> Having plain words is not a good idea for webpage stuff
[May 30 18:49:48] <@Eko> so, vote "KTHXBYE only closes HAI and exits with good condition (something else for exiting in between HAI/KTHXBYE)?"
[May 30 18:49:50] <+Ihoss> <?HAI would be better
[May 30 18:50:05] <@Eko> Ihoss, that can be specific to the web interpreter though
[May 30 18:50:17] <@Eko> that was a motion, btw ^^
[May 30 18:50:20] <+aarcane> Eko, I think it should be defined for all interpreters
[May 30 18:50:21] <@lolcode_com> (please, think beyond PHP. the world is not a nail for that hammer)
[May 30 18:50:22] <+Ihoss> yup, but thenyou cant write HAI on the webpage ;)
[May 30 18:50:23] <+Tetraboy> Yeah, and it's not really needed.
[May 30 18:50:35] * johan-s thinks we should look beyond how php does it
[May 30 18:50:39] <+johan-s> lolcode_com: :)
[May 30 18:50:42] <@lolcode_com> we have quotes
[May 30 18:50:56] <+aarcane> well, is LOLCODE supposed to be interpreted, compiled, or both ?
[May 30 18:51:14] <+johan-s> if you wanna do webpages with lol just do it like every other non-php lang
[May 30 18:51:19] <@Eko> aarcane, interpreted, transcoded, or compiled, any.
[May 30 18:51:22] <+viraptor> probably it won't have a compiler for a long time...
[May 30 18:51:29] <@Eko> viraptor, i've got one already
[May 30 18:51:31] <+aarcane> alreaedy has one.
[May 30 18:51:36] <+viraptor> ok :)
[May 30 18:51:42] <@Eko> it's really basic but there.
[May 30 18:51:47] <@lolcode_com> if we keep it small and light and low-level, a compiler can come sooner.
[May 30 18:51:54] <@Eko> so, I move that we vote "KTHXBYE only closes HAI and exits with good condition (something else for exiting in between HAI/KTHXBYE)?"
[May 30 18:52:03] <+KrazyJim> seconded
[May 30 18:52:04] <+aarcane> second
[May 30 18:52:05] <@Eko> lolcode_com, i'm trying to move it that way

[May 30 18:53:09] <@Eko> okay, should we do the other exit things now?
[May 30 18:53:26] <@Eko> what I tentatively called DIAF/BBL?
[May 30 18:53:28] <@lolcode_com> sure
[May 30 18:53:28] <+Tetraboy> OHNOZOR "I be dead"
[May 30 18:53:43] <+Ihoss> lol
[May 30 18:53:43] <@Eko> I've seen a lot of "OH NO" things being earmarked for exceptions
[May 30 18:53:46] <+aarcane> OHNOZOR sounds more like an error call
[May 30 18:54:01] <+johan-s> or exception raise
[May 30 18:54:08] <+Tetraboy> DIAF "Bad skillz"
[May 30 18:54:09] <+Ihoss> DIAF/BBL sounds good for ending the program
[May 30 18:54:11] <@Eko> I haven't seen DIAF (die in a fire) or BBL (be back later) or BYES used anywhere
[May 30 18:54:12] <+Tetraboy> that'd be fine too

[May 30 18:54:32] <+Ihoss> BYES would be better than BBL
[May 30 18:54:32] <@Eko> BBL doesn't really sound like exit though
[May 30 18:54:34] <@Eko> right
[May 30 18:54:35] <+viraptor> DIAF is really good
[May 30 18:54:37] <+KrazyJim> I think just one exit statement is needed, and a constant OHNOES and HURRAY passed?
[May 30 18:54:42] <+viraptor> BBL / BYES... no idea
[May 30 18:54:51] <+johan-s> uhm
[May 30 18:55:02] <+Tetraboy> BBL should be sleep()
[May 30 18:55:06] <@Eko> ah
[May 30 18:55:07] <@Eko> good call.
[May 30 18:55:18] <+Ihoss> agreed
[May 30 18:55:25] <@Eko> so, first, motion to DIAF <integer status code>?
[May 30 18:55:31] <@Eko> vote on*
[May 30 18:55:35] <+KrazyJim> seconded
[May 30 18:55:38] <+Tetraboy> Eko
[May 30 18:55:41] <@Eko> yes?
[May 30 18:55:47] <+Tetraboy> DIAF "Text error"
[May 30 18:55:54] <+Tetraboy> Would that be ok too? with or without quotes
[May 30 18:55:55] <+Ihoss> DIAF <integer>
[May 30 18:55:57] <+KrazyJim> I prefer numerical constants
[May 30 18:55:59] <+Ihoss> <texterror>
[May 30 18:56:03] <@Eko> integer would be best
[May 30 18:56:04] <+KrazyJim> since they're easier to use in scripts
[May 30 18:56:07] <@Eko> esp. for you PHP guys
[May 30 18:56:14] <@Eko> DIAF 404
[May 30 18:56:19] <+Ihoss> both
[May 30 18:56:21] <+aarcane> integer is bad for PHP actually
[May 30 18:56:27] <+Ihoss> DIAF 404 "Not found"
[May 30 18:56:48] <@Eko> we could do both integer and string for error
[May 30 18:56:52] <+aarcane> but I think it should be OHNOEZOR "error message"\n DIAF 666
[May 30 18:56:54] <+viraptor> DIAF [<num> [<text>]] ?
[May 30 18:56:58] <@Eko> right viraptor

[May 30 18:58:08] <+Tetraboy> Why the nos?
[May 30 18:58:08] <+aarcane> :(
[May 30 18:58:14] <@Eko> what other reasons for no?
[May 30 18:58:20] <@Eko> just curious.
[May 30 18:58:23] <+Tetraboy> eko: I'm starting to see your idea for the lang.
[May 30 18:58:29] <@Eko> Tetraboy?
[May 30 18:58:32] <@Eko> easy to compile?
[May 30 18:58:34] <@Eko> =)
[May 30 18:58:55] <+aarcane> I think it's a bad idea, and that a simple "VISIBLE "error message" \n "DIAF 666" is better.
[May 30 18:58:59] <@Eko> I think the easier it is to compile, the easier it will be to transcode and implement
[May 30 18:59:12] <@Eko> aarcane, and that's what I'd probably do in my code
[May 30 18:59:14] <+johan-s> Eko: I'd solve it in another way, eg with a SystemExit exception or something
[May 30 18:59:21] <+Ihoss> woho! 8 hours till my exam :p
[May 30 18:59:21] <@Eko> but I recognize that there is going to be a significant push for PHP people
[May 30 18:59:26] <+johan-s> then peoples could do their own die() or exit()
[May 30 18:59:42] <+viraptor> woho! 3.5 hours till sunrise :p
[May 30 18:59:52] <+aarcane> SO IM LIKE die WITH errorcode AND message
[May 30 18:59:55] <+johan-s> (except that would't solve actual exit _Codes_ but)
[May 30 19:00:00] <@Eko> oh, and exit codes should be the standard system bad code (nonzero for unix)
[May 30 19:00:13] <@Eko> right?
[May 30 19:00:21] <+aarcane> 0 = good on unix
[May 30 19:00:23] <@Eko> I presume 400 for php or whatever
[May 30 19:00:26] <+Tetraboy> There's probably a big difference in easy to compile and easy to transcode
[May 30 19:00:26] <+viraptor> yup
[May 30 19:00:26] <+Ihoss> ok
[May 30 19:00:31] <@Eko> k
[May 30 19:00:34] <+Ihoss> I like 0
[May 30 19:00:37] <@Eko> is that voteworthy?
[May 30 19:00:40] <@Eko> eh
[May 30 19:00:41] <+Ihoss> similar to MySQL :p
[May 30 19:00:43] <+johan-s> I really don't like the php inspirations here ;)
[May 30 19:00:44] <@Eko> I think it shold be system independant
[May 30 19:00:52] <+aarcane> default exit code should be context relative
[May 30 19:00:58] <@Eko> Ihoss, actually, mysql returns 0 on success and >= 1 on failure
[May 30 19:01:00] <@lolcode_com> is that necessary now?
[May 30 19:01:03] <+Tetraboy> Easiest to transcode is leaving everything as functions.
[May 30 19:01:17] <@Eko> okay, we'll leave that up to the compiler
[May 30 19:01:22] <@Eko> DIAF should return something "bad"
[May 30 19:01:27] <@Eko> /interpreter
[May 30 19:01:42] <+aarcane> Eko, no, I think we should leave it up to the ENVIRONMENT, not the compiler.
[May 30 19:01:59] <@Eko> aarcane, well, the compiler/interpreter has to know the environment.
[May 30 19:02:07] <@Eko> a compiler has to specify the error code, as does the interpreter.
[May 30 19:02:16] <+Ihoss> yeah, a webserver has to return 200 on success
[May 30 19:02:27] <+Ihoss> but thats up to the compiler
[May 30 19:02:33] <@Eko> so we'll leave the defaults up to the interpreter.
[May 30 19:02:39] <@Eko> as they probably know best.
[May 30 19:02:48] <+johan-s> Ihoss: VISIBLE "Status: 200\r\nbody..."
[May 30 19:02:49] <+aarcane> Ihoss, BUT, the CGI binary has to return 0 on success, and send a 200 header.  if it returns 200, it sends no data.
[May 30 19:03:21] <@Eko> aarcane, but the LOLCODE is not the CGI script, the interpreter is
[May 30 19:03:30] <@Eko> if the interpreter dies, it should return nonzero
[May 30 19:03:40] <@Eko> if the script dies, it should return 400 or whatever
[May 30 19:03:41] <@Eko> er
[May 30 19:03:45] <@Eko> the script should return 400
[May 30 19:03:56] <@Eko> the itnerpreter still ran fine, so it shuld return 0 in any case.
[May 30 19:04:01] <@Eko> but anyway
[May 30 19:04:05] <@Eko> BYES?
[May 30 19:04:07] <@Eko> or something else.
[May 30 19:04:11] <@lolcode_com> okay, can we punt on this? it sounds like something that will be made more apparent with implementations and code.
[May 30 19:04:38] <+Ihoss> on BYES or DIAF
[May 30 19:04:46] * lolcode_com wants to get *a* night of sleep without worrying about server meltdown
[May 30 19:04:48] <+aarcane> I move to pass on this and come back to it
[May 30 19:04:49] <+johan-s> seconded on punting
[May 30 19:04:51] <@Eko> what diaf returns by default
[May 30 19:04:52] <+Tetraboy> DIAF <text>
[May 30 19:05:04] <+Ihoss> lets move on
[May 30 19:05:04] <@Eko> we already decided on syntax.
[May 30 19:05:10] <@Eko> we'll punt on the defaults.
[May 30 19:05:23] <@Eko> any other suggestions other than BYES?
[May 30 19:05:24] <+Ihoss> syntax is more important than default behaviour
[May 30 19:05:31] <@Eko> right.
[May 30 19:05:49] <+johan-s> (btw this is not in the agenda ;))
[May 30 19:06:02] <@Eko> johan-s, this is still in the KTHXBYE section.
[May 30 19:06:16] <@Eko> I asked earlier if they wanted to do it now or wait, adn they said now was fine ;)
[May 30 19:06:40] <+Ihoss> I vote for using BYES
[May 30 19:06:40] <@Eko> I move that we vote to approve "BYES [<code> [<text>]]"?
[May 30 19:06:40] <+johan-s> ENUFF ?

[May 30 19:08:26] <@Eko> next is: IM IN YR
[May 30 19:08:46] <@Eko> so, the question I see is: label or no label.  I move that we vote on this?
[May 30 19:09:01] <+Ihoss> IM IN UR / IM OUTTA UR
[May 30 19:09:03] <+Tetraboy> What would the label do?
[May 30 19:09:05] <@lolcode_com> Labels are syntactic sugar here.
[May 30 19:09:12] <@lolcode_com> mostly, so far.
[May 30 19:09:12] <@Eko> actually, I disagree lolcode_com
[May 30 19:09:14] <+viraptor> I'm for label - you can GTFO to a label
[May 30 19:09:16] <+KrazyJim> I think we could permit labels,  but just ignore them
[May 30 19:09:18] <+Ihoss> you could go out of a loop higher up
[May 30 19:09:22] <@Eko> if you have a label
[May 30 19:09:38] <@Eko> you can exit from or continue or whatever within a nested loop
[May 30 19:09:55] <+Ihoss> double purpose then
[May 30 19:10:05] <@Eko> both labeling and functional
[May 30 19:10:07] <+KrazyJim> There's no need for labels for nesting is there?
[May 30 19:10:12] <+johan-s> IM IN YR LOOP .... inner loop code IM OUTTA YA LOOP
[May 30 19:10:25] <@Eko> we're not dealing with outta yr loop yet.
[May 30 19:10:28] <@Eko> just im in yr loop
[May 30 19:10:31] <+Tetraboy> I say no labels.
[May 30 19:10:40] <+KrazyJim> i agree with Tetraboy
[May 30 19:10:41] <+viraptor> someone posted this http://rafb.net/p/wWgAIl83.html before
[May 30 19:10:47] <@Eko> yeah, thanks,
[May 30 19:10:49] <@Eko> I couldn't find that
[May 30 19:11:01] <+Ihoss> IM IN YR LOOP IM IN R LOP2 CONTINUE LOOP ...
[May 30 19:11:03] <+johan-s> yes thats what I suggested
[May 30 19:11:04] <+viraptor> you can skip a couple of levels at once
[May 30 19:11:14] * Eko sets modes [##LOLCODE +v Anxiety]
[May 30 19:11:15] <+viraptor> like a poor man's exceptins
[May 30 19:11:18] <+aarcane> I think our loops should be responsible for terminating themselves
[May 30 19:11:33] <+aarcane> so we need an if to end a loop, instead of using for and while
[May 30 19:11:38] <@Eko> I can work with it either way
[May 30 19:11:43] <@Eko> I move that we vote?
[May 30 19:11:46] <+Anxiety> Is it ok if I just post it? or do you need me to wait a sec?
[May 30 19:12:06] <@Eko> Anxiety, we're working on speccing out a more formal version of the language right now
[May 30 19:12:13] <@Eko> so you might want to see what happens first
[May 30 19:12:14] <+Tetraboy> I say KTHX instead outta yr loop
[May 30 19:12:23] <@Eko> Tetraboy, me too, but we'ren ot there yet ;)
[May 30 19:12:26] <+aarcane> Tetraboy, I agree
[May 30 19:12:28] <+Tetraboy> ah k.
[May 30 19:12:30] <+aarcane> wait
[May 30 19:12:39] <+Anxiety> ok

[May 30 19:12:55] <+aarcane> Tetraboy, does the first instance of KTHX end the loop, or does it make it loop ?
[May 30 19:13:00] <+johan-s> http://rafb.net/p/TpUyMM40.html some like that (conditionals decided later)

[May 30 19:14:34] <@lolcode_com> second revote
[May 30 19:14:37] <+viraptor> wait - so we can still use them if they are optional?
[May 30 19:14:41] <@Eko> yes
[May 30 19:14:45] <+viraptor> i mean - for jumping out?
[May 30 19:14:45] <@Eko> but not for breaking or continuing
[May 30 19:14:52] <+johan-s> make the vote, labels yes/no
[May 30 19:15:01] <@Eko> then we can decide afterwards, sure
[May 30 19:15:03] <+Ihoss> why not breaking or continuing?

[May 30 19:15:45] <+Ihoss> lol
[May 30 19:15:48] <+Tetraboy> fun.
[May 30 19:15:51] <@Eko> so much for abstaining.
[May 30 19:15:55] <+aarcane> I'll add a late vote for yes if it'll work
[May 30 19:16:05] <@Eko> haha, I would've thrown in my vote for no.
[May 30 19:16:14] <+aarcane> so we're still tied.
[May 30 19:16:15] <+Ihoss> so, why do people not want the label?
[May 30 19:16:15] <@Eko> sigh.
[May 30 19:16:20] <@lolcode_com> what's the next discussion point in this item?
[May 30 19:16:25] <+Tetraboy> Ihoss, cause it'd be hard to transcode.
[May 30 19:16:33] <+Ihoss> mhm
[May 30 19:16:34] <@Eko> I suppose it would be continue/break
[May 30 19:16:39] <+johan-s> Ihoss: I just want IM IN YR LOOP
[May 30 19:16:40] <+KrazyJim> I think it's bad, since it makes code spaghetti easier and involves lots of jumping round a program
[May 30 19:16:43] <@Eko> oh wait
[May 30 19:16:45] <@Eko> it's IM OUTTA YR
[May 30 19:17:05] <+johan-s> KrazyJim: agreed
[May 30 19:17:06] <@Eko> I say that IM OUTTA YR should be replaced with KTHX
[May 30 19:17:18] <+Anxiety> am I allowed to vote?
[May 30 19:17:21] <+Tetraboy> Eko, good idea. IM OUUTTA YR for breaking a loop
[May 30 19:17:23] <@Eko> Anxiety, of course
[May 30 19:17:25] <+aarcane> Anxiety, everyone can vote
[May 30 19:17:27] <@lolcode_com> I can get behind that, actually.
[May 30 19:17:32] <+Anxiety> I second the KTHX
[May 30 19:17:42] <+Tetraboy> asin:
[May 30 19:17:44] <@Eko> KTHX for the "closing bracket" of a loop?
[May 30 19:17:48] <+viraptor> OUTTA is redundant - just like xml end-tags ;)
[May 30 19:17:52] <+viraptor> KTHX
[May 30 19:17:52] <@Eko> I"M OUTTA YR for breaking?
[May 30 19:17:52] <@lolcode_com> yes.
[May 30 19:17:53] <+aarcane> I think KTHX should indicate an end of execution, not for the closing bracket.
[May 30 19:17:53] <+Tetraboy> right eko
[May 30 19:17:59] <+Tetraboy> That's my idea.
[May 30 19:18:06] <+johan-s> well, then KTHX should always be the block terminator, ala end in ruby, or } in c/ecmascript
[May 30 19:18:13] <+KrazyJim> I interpreted it as IM IN UR LOOP .... IM OUTTA UR LOOP looping infinitely
[May 30 19:18:15] <@lolcode_com> that was one construction where inspirations didn't strike.
[May 30 19:18:22] <+KrazyJim> a KTHX or whatever would break out of the loop
[May 30 19:18:27] <+Tetraboy> johan-s: That was the idea. KTHX = }
[May 30 19:18:34] <@Eko> okay, so there is a motion on the table (?) for KTHX to terminate all blocks?
[May 30 19:18:39] <@Eko> do I have a second?
[May 30 19:18:43] <+Ihoss> yes
[May 30 19:18:46] <+KrazyJim> yes
[May 30 19:18:46] <@Eko> (that includes if statements when we get to them)
[May 30 19:18:47] <+Anxiety> yes
[May 30 19:18:47] <+Ihoss> I'm second
[May 30 19:18:49] <+viraptor> ++

[May 30 19:19:16] <@Eko> oh
[May 30 19:19:22] <@Eko> and by terminates, I mean closing bracket wise
[May 30 19:19:36] <@Eko> was that understood or is this vote null and void?
[May 30 19:19:42] <+Tetraboy> understood here
[May 30 19:19:43] <+Anxiety> I understood it as that
[May 30 19:19:46] <+aarcane> understood
[May 30 19:19:46] <@lolcode_com> so but another behavior I've been considering would be to refactor http://rafb.net/p/wWgAIl83.html so that lin 9 is leagally KTHXBYE and ends the program
[May 30 19:19:54] <+KrazyJim> I understood it as breaking
[May 30 19:19:57] <+kYx-ng> The results are in!
[May 30 19:19:57] <+kYx-ng>   KTHX terminates all blocks except HAI?
[May 30 19:19:57] <+kYx-ng>   Yea: 9
[May 30 19:19:57] <+kYx-ng>   Nea: 0
[May 30 19:19:57] <+kYx-ng> The yeas win by a landslide!
[May 30 19:20:04] <@Eko> okay, so we need to rephrase that
[May 30 19:20:43] <@lolcode_com> it just implicitly closes all intervening loops?
[May 30 19:20:45] <@Eko> I move that we: !poll KTHX is the universal "closing bracket" line for any if block, looping block, etc... except HAI
[May 30 19:20:59] <@lolcode_com> instead of KTHX KTHX KTHX KTHXBYE on the linked page
[May 30 19:21:01] <@Eko> is that more clear?
[May 30 19:21:15] <+KrazyJim> yeah that's better
[May 30 19:21:23] <@Eko> lolcode_com, uh, then how do you put more statements after a kthx before another?
[May 30 19:21:26] <+aarcane> Eko, thats good, but you should specify that it applies to any block, including functions
[May 30 19:21:27] <@Eko> just closes one block
[May 30 19:21:28] <+Ihoss> but you still need as many kthx as you had loops, ifs
[May 30 19:21:28] <+johan-s> (could be for HAI too)
[May 30 19:21:37] <@Eko> I move that we: !poll KTHX is the universal "closing bracket" line for any if block, looping block, function, etc... except HAI
[May 30 19:21:38] <+johan-s> since thats just the "main" block
[May 30 19:21:49] <+aarcane> seconded
[May 30 19:21:49] <@Eko> kthxbye is for HAI only
[May 30 19:21:58] <@Eko> !poll 45s KTHX is the universal "closing bracket" line for any if block, looping block, function, etc... except HAI

[May 30 19:23:13] <@Eko> I move that we: !poll IM OUTTA [YR <label> | HERE] for the break statement
[May 30 19:23:31] <+Ihoss> seconededed
[May 30 19:23:39] <@Eko> anyone have an amendment?
[May 30 19:23:42] <@lolcode_com> "the break statement?"
[May 30 19:23:44] <@Eko> yeah
[May 30 19:23:58] <@Eko> to break from the (innermost for HERE | loop with <label>)
[May 30 19:24:00] <+Anxiety> it works for me
[May 30 19:24:18] <@lolcode_com> ok cool
[May 30 19:24:19] <+viraptor> i'd like the gtfo
[May 30 19:24:22] <+viraptor> it's shorter
[May 30 19:24:22] <+Tetraboy> IM OUTTA YR <lable>
[May 30 19:24:29] <@Eko> hmm.
[May 30 19:24:31] <+KrazyJim> sounds good although i implemented kthx and im outta backwards :)
[May 30 19:24:32] <@lolcode_com> "shorter"?
[May 30 19:24:33] <@Eko> I like GTFO too.
[May 30 19:24:37] <@Eko> for a general break
[May 30 19:24:41] <+Anxiety> gfto sounds more like an order then a statement
[May 30 19:25:00] <+viraptor> break is an order too :)
[May 30 19:25:01] <+KrazyJim> GTFO is closer to break for me
[May 30 19:25:06] <@Eko> it is... it's saying get me out of this innermost loop right now
[May 30 19:25:21] <+Tetraboy> How about "OUTTA <lable>"
[May 30 19:25:27] <+johan-s> uhm
[May 30 19:25:30] <+Ihoss> GTFO is better then
[May 30 19:25:30] <+KrazyJim> what about GTG
[May 30 19:25:36] <+johan-s> so this is why labels are bad
[May 30 19:25:39] <@Eko> KrazyJim, that sounds like an error condition
[May 30 19:25:43] <+johan-s> what happens when you break the outer loop
[May 30 19:25:45] <+KrazyJim> good point
[May 30 19:25:56] <+Ihoss> you break the outer loop :p
[May 30 19:25:58] <+Anxiety> Im fine with gtfo
[May 30 19:26:02] <+KrazyJim> if you call break too many times it should ignore it or quit
[May 30 19:26:05] <+johan-s> easier to implement if you only have local context
[May 30 19:26:06] <@Eko> okay, so I say we vote between I"M OUTTA YR and GTFO
[May 30 19:26:08] <+KrazyJim> i'd push for quit
[May 30 19:26:12] <+johan-s> and just need to break in each
[May 30 19:26:14] <+KrazyJim> seconded eko
[May 30 19:26:28] <+Ihoss> difficult choice
[May 30 19:26:30] <+viraptor> with GTFO we'll be NSFW :)
[May 30 19:26:33] <@Eko> !poll 20s I"M OUTTA YR (!yes) or GTFO (!no)
[May 30 19:26:35] <+kYx-ng> A poll is being started:

[May 30 19:30:07] <+johan-s> Eko: last one, killings is bad? yes for yes, no for optional
[May 30 19:30:12] <+aarcane> Eko, a bunch have been fairly ambiguous
[May 30 19:30:34] <+Tetraboy> I say we limit things to simple yes/no
[May 30 19:30:44] <+Tetraboy> Instead of yes/no,but
[May 30 19:30:49] <+Tetraboy> :)
[May 30 19:30:52] <+johan-s> yup
[May 30 19:30:54] <+KrazyJim> I think the options are ok, as long as they're detailed before the voet

[May 30 19:31:20] <+Ihoss> post yes and no on induvidual lines
[May 30 19:31:40] <+Ihoss> YES: keep label, but they have no effect
[May 30 19:31:50] <+Ihoss> NO: Get rid of labels altogether
[May 30 19:31:57] <+Tetraboy> I say, no buts
[May 30 19:31:59] <+johan-s> do you take it in the butt? yes or no (except on tuesdays)
[May 30 19:32:13] <@lolcode_com> wednesdays!
[May 30 19:32:17] <@Eko> don't ask that question
[May 30 19:32:18] <+viraptor> what about keeping + effect?
[May 30 19:32:21] <@Eko> you might be surprised about the answer =P
[May 30 19:32:53] * Eko motions to vote on labels being allowed or not
[May 30 19:33:04] <+johan-s> second
[May 30 19:33:05] <+Tetraboy> As in Keep lable (yes,no)? if yes: Label has no effect (yes/no)
[May 30 19:33:05] <+Anxiety> second
[May 30 19:33:06] <+Ihoss> hang on
[May 30 19:33:25] <+Ihoss> I want labels to be there, but they dont do anything
[May 30 19:33:35] <+Ihoss> as in Adams original idea
[May 30 19:33:37] <+Tetraboy> First vote: allow labels
[May 30 19:33:47] <@Eko> right @ Tetraboy
[May 30 19:33:49] <+Tetraboy> Second vote: Must labels do anything
[May 30 19:33:53] <+Ihoss> ok
[May 30 19:34:03] <+KrazyJim> sounds good

[May 30 19:35:41] <+Ihoss> continue, break
[May 30 19:35:41] <@Eko> it has an effect.
[May 30 19:35:49] <@Eko> but yeah, continue break mostly.
[May 30 19:35:56] <@Eko> !poll 30s Should labels have an effect?
[May 30 19:35:56] <+Anxiety> I think they should have an effect (such as debugging info) but not an effect in the application itself

[May 30 19:38:19] <@lolcode_com> VISIBLE  is immediately clear to readers on the hello world example
[May 30 19:38:22] <+KrazyJim> its a reference to invisible sandwich, and everything that followed
[May 30 19:38:27] <@Eko> (you can start the poll, johan-s)
[May 30 19:38:32] <@lolcode_com> exactly
[May 30 19:38:44] <+Anxiety> I think SAY or SAYING would be clearer

[May 30 19:39:32] <+johan-s> can do recount after discussion
[May 30 19:39:39] <+johan-s> ?
[May 30 19:39:44] <+Anxiety> I like SEZ
[May 30 19:39:47] <@Eko> I think the votes speak for themselves
[May 30 19:39:51] <+Anxiety> or I SEZ
[May 30 19:39:56] <+KrazyJim> (apologies for my apostrophe abuse too)
[May 30 19:40:06] <@Eko> question though
[May 30 19:40:11] <@lolcode_com> that's for the speech synthesizer cartridge
[May 30 19:40:15] <@Eko> haha
[May 30 19:40:27] <@Eko> visible prints to stdout, with a newline following?
[May 30 19:40:37] <+johan-s> tbd
[May 30 19:40:40] <@Eko> or should there be a ! at the end for no newline (as was suggested)
[May 30 19:40:42] <@lolcode_com> yes, by default.
[May 30 19:40:53] <+Anxiety> visible, if used like in the examples and stuff... would do a lot of formatting on its own
[May 30 19:40:54] <+johan-s> but I'd say yes
[May 30 19:40:56] <@lolcode_com> interesting extension.
[May 30 19:41:26] <@Eko> I would say visible prints the variable(s) in question in the most minimal form possible to convey what it is
[May 30 19:41:26] <+viraptor> ! is nice choice
[May 30 19:41:43] <@Eko> no quote padding, no zero padding, etc
[May 30 19:41:51] <@Eko> and a newline at the end unless !.
[May 30 19:41:59] <@lolcode_com> sounds good.
[May 30 19:42:04] <@Eko> motion to ratify?
[May 30 19:42:04] <+Anxiety> would we have other keywords for formatting options?
[May 30 19:42:07] <+Ihoss> whats quote padding?
[May 30 19:42:10] <+Tetraboy> I say no newline
[May 30 19:42:16] <@Eko> Anxiety, other functions to be implemented in future
[May 30 19:42:17] <+Tetraboy> use \N if you want a newline
[May 30 19:42:37] <@Eko> Ihoss, that would put quotes around a string but not a number.
[May 30 19:42:37] <+Anxiety> ok
[May 30 19:42:39] * lolcode_com flinches at the punctuation
[May 30 19:42:46] <@Eko> lol lolcode_com
[May 30 19:42:58] <@Eko> motion to vote on minimal printing with newline unless ! at the end?

[May 30 19:43:25] <+johan-s> thats two different votes perhaps
[May 30 19:43:30] <+Anxiety> VISIBLE "SOmething with no newline"!
[May 30 19:43:30] <+Anxiety> ?
[May 30 19:43:41] <+johan-s> yes no on newline... yes no on ! functions
[May 30 19:43:49] <+johan-s> oh
[May 30 19:44:04] <+johan-s> thought you meant VISIBLE! "foo"
[May 30 19:44:05] <+Jessicatz> ! functions?
[May 30 19:44:05] <+Ihoss> someone define theoptions and start the pool

[May 30 19:45:23] <@Eko> okay, I HAS A
[May 30 19:45:27] <@Eko> this one should get interesting.
[May 30 19:45:39] <+Jessicatz> I like it. what are the alternatives?

[May 30 19:45:51] <+Ihoss> I HAS A <var> ITZ
[May 30 19:45:52] <@Eko> Jessicatz, see the agenda, I posted a few

[May 30 19:48:13] <+Anxiety> before we get to assignment... has there been a vote on strong types?
[May 30 19:48:21] <@Eko> Anxiety, not yet >_<
[May 30 19:48:23] <+Ihoss> ITZA for objects
[May 30 19:48:24] * Aristarchus (n=wsa@76.210.64.169) has joined ##lolcode
[May 30 19:48:31] <+Ihoss> IZA for objects
[May 30 19:48:52] <+Ihoss> we can do objects like javascript/actionscript does
[May 30 19:48:53] <@Eko> I motion that we use "I HAS A [<type> CALLED] <var> ..."
[May 30 19:49:06] <+Tetraboy> Has anyone else realized this is going to be an insanely huge task?
[May 30 19:49:11] <+Tetraboy> :)
[May 30 19:49:11] <+johan-s> negative, entirely diff issue
[May 30 19:49:15] <+johan-s> (strong/weak)
[May 30 19:49:19] <+Anxiety> I liked the idea of I HAS 10 VAR for array :)
[May 30 19:49:48] <@Eko> Tetraboy, most of this stuff isn't all that bad so far, actually
[May 30 19:49:55] <+Ihoss> I say we have 3 types: variable, array and object
[May 30 19:49:55] <@Eko> and we're not doing arrays yet either
[May 30 19:50:09] <@Eko> I proposed earlier that we start out with two basic types
[May 30 19:50:14] <@Eko> NUMBAR and YARN
[May 30 19:50:18] <@Eko> YARN being a string.
[May 30 19:50:19] <+Ihoss> that way we don't need to specify what type a variable is
[May 30 19:50:19] <+Anxiety> I HAS [ A | n ] A [<type> CALLED] <var> [IZ <value>]
[May 30 19:50:22] <@lolcode_com> I say 2: variables and collections of things
[May 30 19:50:46] <+KrazyJim> I think all we need to worry about is primitives and maybe arrays for now
[May 30 19:50:49] <@Eko> I want to say that we should start out with two very basic types that exist in every language
[May 30 19:51:00] <+Jessicatz> agreed
[May 30 19:51:04] <@Eko> and I think array syntax should be different than normal declarations
[May 30 19:51:14] <@Eko> so I say NUMBAR and YARN (string)
[May 30 19:51:18] <+Jessicatz> no I don't think so
[May 30 19:51:24] <+Ihoss> but do we need to specify it?
[May 30 19:51:24] <+Jessicatz> it should be the same syntax
[May 30 19:51:34] <+Ihoss> shouldn't it be obvious from the code?
[May 30 19:51:43] <@lolcode_com> :)
[May 30 19:51:44] <+KrazyJim> I think number and string is all we'll need for now
[May 30 19:51:45] <@Eko> Ihoss, hence why it's in brackets
[May 30 19:51:47] <+Ihoss> I HAS A name ITZ "Ihoss"
[May 30 19:51:53] <@Eko> for basic types, it'll know
[May 30 19:51:58] <@Eko> but for objects and arrays
[May 30 19:52:02] <+KrazyJim> pushing it much further than BASIC is probably not possible in one sitting
[May 30 19:52:04] <@Eko> it should be specified
[May 30 19:52:23] <@Eko> I think we'll adjourn after we get this done and after we do conditionals
[May 30 19:52:25] <+Ihoss> objects are just objects, doesn't matter what object it is
[May 30 19:52:28] <@Eko> and reconvene next week sometime
[May 30 19:52:37] <+johan-s> I HAS A name ITZ BUKKITS OF foo (or what array keyword/syntax we dream up)
[May 30 19:52:41] <@Eko> my fingers are getting tired =)
[May 30 19:52:52] <+Ihoss> I'm getting tired
[May 30 19:52:53] <+Anxiety> I HAS 3 YARN CALLED NAMES IZ "John" "Jack" "Jane"
[May 30 19:52:56] <+Jessicatz> poll for ITZ vs IZ please
[May 30 19:53:06] <+Jessicatz> in I HAS A construct
[May 30 19:53:06] <@Eko> okay, let's do that first
[May 30 19:53:14] <@Eko> I second Jessicatz
[May 30 19:53:18] <@Eko> anyone object?
[May 30 19:53:20] <+Ihoss> heres what i like
[May 30 19:53:26] <+Ihoss> ITZ after I HAS A
[May 30 19:53:36] <+Ihoss> and IZ if the variable has already been defined
[May 30 19:53:36] <+Anxiety> ITZ vs IZ?
[May 30 19:53:44] <+Ihoss> this would make most sense when read
[May 30 19:53:53] <+KrazyJim> i think itz is better since iz will be used in conditionals
[May 30 19:53:55] <+Jessicatz> we are talking about declaration here
[May 30 19:53:57] <@Eko> motion: !poll 30s "I HAS A ... " ITZ (yes) or IZ (no)  " ..."

[May 30 19:55:17] <@lolcode_com> so what does ITZ do?
[May 30 19:55:23] <+johan-s> =
[May 30 19:55:28] <@Eko> lolcode_com, separates the variable name from the value

[May 30 19:56:03] <@Eko> so, now I move that we vote to ratify "NUMBAR, YARN (string), and BUKKIT (array)" as our three basic types
[May 30 19:56:03] <+Ihoss> but then we can use
[May 30 19:56:08] <+Ihoss> number IZ 5

[May 30 19:56:23] <+KrazyJim> I like that idea eko, but how do we specify contents of BUKKITs?
[May 30 19:56:25] <+Jessicatz> we aren't at assignment, yet
[May 30 19:56:31] <+KrazyJim> or do we just not care
[May 30 19:56:39] <@Eko> KrazyJim, I don't think that matters yet...
[May 30 19:56:45] <+Jessicatz> I totally do not know what YARN means
[May 30 19:56:45] <@Eko> the names and types matter
[May 30 19:56:48] <@lolcode_com> I think BUKKITS were promising as stacks and or collections
[May 30 19:56:56] <@Eko> Jessicatz, it's a string as in "blah"
[May 30 19:57:04] <+Jessicatz> no I mean
[May 30 19:57:07] <+Jessicatz> the word YARN
[May 30 19:57:08] <+Anxiety> what about the idea of treating all variables as arrays (normal vars are just an array of single size)
[May 30 19:57:10] <+Jessicatz> oh
[May 30 19:57:11] <+Jessicatz> yarn..
[May 30 19:57:14] <@Eko> lol
[May 30 19:57:14] <+johan-s> < since we pour it into the bukkit ;)   BUKKIT < 1 < 2 < 3
[May 30 19:57:15] <@lolcode_com> well, you're implicitly pushing typing through, and I'm resisting
[May 30 19:57:23] <+Anxiety> that would allow us to spec in easy single to array functionality
[May 30 19:57:30] <+Ihoss> to explain anything to jessicat, just decapitalize it
[May 30 19:57:36] <+Jessicatz> I like Anxietys idea
[May 30 19:57:38] <@Eko> lolcode_com, I'm pretty much giving up on strict typing
[May 30 19:57:52] <@Eko> though I'll fight for it when the time comes
[May 30 19:58:02] <@Eko> but I'm talking from an implementation standpoint
[May 30 19:58:13] <+Ihoss> I say a variable can hold whatever it wants to
[May 30 19:58:15] <+Jessicatz> I propose all types being arrays
[May 30 19:58:20] <@Eko> ooo
[May 30 19:58:22] <@Eko> interesting.
[May 30 19:58:23] <@lolcode_com> what's wrong with making the implementers work a bit?
[May 30 19:58:40] <@Eko> lolcode_com, you still have to know what the types are to be able to convert between them
[May 30 19:58:56] <@Eko> even if you never ever type the type of that variable in your program
[May 30 19:59:05] <@Eko> or check it
[May 30 19:59:08] <+Ihoss> I like Jessicatz idea!
[May 30 19:59:14] <@Eko> that's really interesting
[May 30 19:59:17] <@Eko> like matlab =)
[May 30 19:59:20] <+Anxiety> heh
[May 30 19:59:27] <+Jessicatz> it was Anxietys idea
[May 30 19:59:39] <@Eko> interesting.
[May 30 19:59:43] <@Eko> iiinteresting.
[May 30 19:59:46] <@Eko> I like it.
[May 30 19:59:50] <+Ihoss> Thats an ingenious idea
[May 30 19:59:54] <+Ihoss> it would be awsome
[May 30 19:59:57] <@Eko> yeah
[May 30 20:00:02] <+KrazyJim> accessing variables would be a bit of a pain in the ass though
[May 30 20:00:06] <@Eko> matlab does lots of cool sutff with it
[May 30 20:00:12] <@lolcode_com> sounds like a way of getting what I want
[May 30 20:00:13] <+Anxiety> you could even treat the arrays like queues
[May 30 20:00:14] <+KrazyJim> unless we implicitly access the 0th item in the array unless a number is specified
[May 30 20:00:17] <+Ihoss> <var> ##
[May 30 20:00:29] <@Eko> KrazyJim, you always reference the thing as a whole
[May 30 20:00:30] <+Jessicatz> only the var name is always the first element
[May 30 20:00:38] <+Ihoss> Array funcion EMO should cut the array in two
[May 30 20:00:43] <+Jessicatz> heh
[May 30 20:00:54] <@Eko> okay, well let's vote on the everything-is-an-array concept

[May 30 20:01:40] <+kYx-ng>   Is everything an array?
[May 30 20:01:40] <+kYx-ng>   Yea: 6
[May 30 20:01:40] <+kYx-ng>   Nea: 1
[May 30 20:01:40] <+kYx-ng> The yeas win by a landslide!
[May 30 20:01:46] <@Eko> sweet.
[May 30 20:01:52] <+Ihoss> does the array have dynamic length?
[May 30 20:02:00] <+Anxiety> I would assume so
[May 30 20:02:02] <@Eko> yes, I presume.
[May 30 20:02:11] <+Ihoss> good
[May 30 20:02:15] <@Eko> I move that we put it to a vote though.
[May 30 20:02:20] <+Jessicatz> hm
[May 30 20:02:23] <@Eko> well actually
[May 30 20:02:40] <@Eko> I think you can only extend it by using some concatenate operator
[May 30 20:02:42] <@lolcode_com> can we go away and work thru the implications?
[May 30 20:03:07] <@Eko> we need syntax for this, assignment, and conditionals to have a working language
[May 30 20:03:16] <@Eko> imho
[May 30 20:03:19] <+Anxiety> MYARRAY IZ "Blue", MYARRAY IZ ALSO "Red"
[May 30 20:03:19] <@Eko> does anyone disagree?
[May 30 20:03:30] <+Jessicatz> no, agreed
[May 30 20:03:35] * johan-s (n=johan@84.209.234.220) has left ##LOLCODE
[May 30 20:03:42] <+Jessicatz> hm
[May 30 20:03:43] <@Eko> okay.... so, let's finish up I HAS A.
[May 30 20:03:46] <+Ihoss> didn't we decide on I HAS A <var> ITZ
[May 30 20:03:53] <+KrazyJim> mm
[May 30 20:03:54] <@Eko> howabout we, FOR NOW, don't allow initializers on the same line
[May 30 20:03:54] <+Jessicatz> yes we did
[May 30 20:04:06] <@Eko> until we decide how to put an array on one line
[May 30 20:04:09] <+Jessicatz> Eko: what do you mean exactly
[May 30 20:04:10] <+KrazyJim> I HAS A <var> ITZ 2 N 4 N 12...
[May 30 20:04:18] <@Eko> only allow "I HAS A <var>"
[May 30 20:04:26] <+KrazyJim> sounds good for now
[May 30 20:04:26] <@Eko> we'll decide how to do the "ITZ <...>" later
[May 30 20:04:32] <+Jessicatz> ah
[May 30 20:04:38] <+Ihoss> krazyJim, that would be a problem with yarns
[May 30 20:04:42] <@Eko> let people on the wiki make suggestions
[May 30 20:04:48] <+Jessicatz> yea, sounds good to me, especially with ITZ being used for array initialization too
[May 30 20:04:56] <+Ihoss> ok, but how do we specify the position in the array
[May 30 20:05:13] <+Anxiety> well, I think we should vote on strong typing vs dynamic variables... that affects many other things we decide on
[May 30 20:05:15] <+KrazyJim> i think <var>[n] is best
[May 30 20:05:20] <@Eko> !poll 30s Table the ITZ ... portion of the assignment for another meeting (and for wiki suggestions?

[May 30 20:06:02] <@lolcode_com> for array indexing: <index> IN MAH <var>
[May 30 20:06:14] <+Jessicatz> nice
[May 30 20:06:26] <+Jessicatz> what about object properties
[May 30 20:06:30] <@lolcode_com> could accept ordinals?
[May 30 20:06:33] <@lolcode_com> FIRST!!
[May 30 20:06:36] <+Anxiety> they could also be used like queues or iterators
[May 30 20:06:39] <+Ihoss> yeah, in the same way that objects would be <function> IN UR <object> IN UR <object>
[May 30 20:06:47] <+Jessicatz> okay I like that
[May 30 20:06:53] <+KrazyJim> "OOP, Databases, etc. should all

[May 30 20:07:20] <+Anxiety> VISIBLE ALL MYARRAY
[May 30 20:07:54] <@Eko> we need to decide on this =/
[May 30 20:07:55] <+Ihoss> I like index IN MAX var
[May 30 20:07:58] <@Eko> so do I
[May 30 20:08:09] <@Eko> it's interesting
[May 30 20:08:09] <+Ihoss> BTW should variables be lowercase?
[May 30 20:08:22] <+Jessicatz> Ihoss: inmho they should, but they don't have to
[May 30 20:08:24] <@Eko> no specification for now, imho
[May 30 20:08:30] <@Eko> let the programmer choose.
[May 30 20:08:33] <+Anxiety> the variables could be addressed both as in index and as an iterator
[May 30 20:08:35] <+Jessicatz> imho locats should be case insensitive

[May 30 20:08:54] <+Anxiety> ok
[May 30 20:08:54] <+krallja> Hi
[May 30 20:08:58] <+KrazyJim> hi
[May 30 20:08:59] <@Eko> heya pinano.
[May 30 20:09:08] <+krallja> Eko: you know this already, but i has an interpreter going
[May 30 20:09:09] <@lolcode_com> hi
[May 30 20:09:19] <@Eko> we're working on array indexing at the moment.
[May 30 20:09:25] <+krallja> ok
[May 30 20:09:32] <@Eko> <index> IN MAH <var> seems to be the consensus so far
[May 30 20:09:33] <+Jessicatz> ## IN MAH var seems okay
[May 30 20:09:39] <+krallja> i like it
[May 30 20:09:41] <+krallja> is adam lindsay here?
[May 30 20:09:42] <@Eko> but I think you should be able to switch them too
[May 30 20:09:42] <+Anxiety> I can agree with that
[May 30 20:09:44] <@Eko> like in C =)
[May 30 20:09:46] <@lolcode_com> that's me
[May 30 20:09:48] <+Jessicatz> what about multidmiension
[May 30 20:09:51] <+krallja> hi adam :)
[May 30 20:09:52] * lolcode_com waves
[May 30 20:09:59] <+krallja> idiots are taking over the wiki
[May 30 20:10:04] <@Eko> Jessicatz, <a> IN MAH <b> IN MAH <var>
[May 30 20:10:04] <+Jessicatz> ## IN MAH ## IN MAH arr1 arr2?
[May 30 20:10:17] <+Ihoss> yeah
[May 30 20:10:19] <@Eko> you don't need two arrays
[May 30 20:10:20] <+Anxiety> ##, ## IN MAH arr
[May 30 20:10:24] <+Jessicatz> hm okay
[May 30 20:10:25] <@lolcode_com> I was worried about that. it's my last bit of AOB.
[May 30 20:10:33] <+Jessicatz> wtf commas?
[May 30 20:10:40] <+Jessicatz> I vote against commas
[May 30 20:10:42] <@Eko> noes @ commas
[May 30 20:10:45] <+Anxiety> hehe
[May 30 20:10:56] <@lolcode_com> N in place of commas
[May 30 20:11:06] <+krallja> isn't N used for string concatenation?
[May 30 20:11:11] <@Eko> why not ## IN MAH ## IN MAH <var>?
[May 30 20:11:13] <+Ihoss> yeah, lets use IN MAH
[May 30 20:11:16] <@Eko> krallja, that's not specced yet
[May 30 20:11:19] <+krallja> ok
[May 30 20:11:19] <+Anxiety> well, there is the implimentation concern if we are doing multiple dimension arrays, vs arrays of arrays
[May 30 20:11:26] <+Jessicatz> double IN MAH is verbose but okay
[May 30 20:11:28] <@lolcode_com> I thought at first, but it works just as fine if its a sort of conjunction
[May 30 20:11:39] <@lolcode_com> in the VISIBLE this N that example
[May 30 20:11:47] <@Eko> so, before we vote on ## IN MAH ## IN MAH <var>
[May 30 20:11:54] <@lolcode_com> PRINT this, that
[May 30 20:11:57] <+Jessicatz> (N should be purely concat imho)
[May 30 20:12:02] <@Eko> I agree Jessicatz
[May 30 20:12:07] <+Anxiety> looks fine to me, Eko
[May 30 20:12:21] <@Eko> how do we know the dimensions of an array?
[May 30 20:12:31] <@Eko> the biggest index that has been assigned to in any given direction?
[May 30 20:12:34] <+Ihoss> the last element
[May 30 20:12:39] <+krallja> that's how javascript does it
[May 30 20:12:44] <+krallja> and i like how that works
[May 30 20:12:47] <+Ihoss> yeah, but negative index?
[May 30 20:12:59] <@Eko> so, if you have 50 IN MAH BUCKIT, you have a 50x1 array
[May 30 20:13:00] <+Jessicatz> indexes should be strings
[May 30 20:13:02] <+Jessicatz> or objects
[May 30 20:13:13] <@Eko> eep, Jessicatz.
[May 30 20:13:14] <+Ihoss> like PHP?
[May 30 20:13:15] <+krallja> then it's a map instead of an array
[May 30 20:13:15] <+Ihoss> no
[May 30 20:13:26] <@Eko> not yet, Jessicatz ;)
[May 30 20:13:31] <+Jessicatz> okay, but everything is an array
[May 30 20:13:32] <+KrazyJim> I think it's getting a little overcomplicated again
[May 30 20:13:34] <@Eko> right.
[May 30 20:13:40] <+Jessicatz> hm
[May 30 20:14:03] <@lolcode_com> motion to table & sleep on it?
[May 30 20:14:04] <+Ihoss> so vote on ## IN MAH ## IN MAH var?

[May 30 20:15:31] <+krallja> I like Eko's proposal

[May 30 20:15:42] <@Eko> haha
[May 30 20:15:43] <+krallja> Actually hold on
[May 30 20:15:47] <+krallja> I currently have it implemented as

[May 30 20:15:53] <@Eko> that works too, Jessicatz

[May 30 20:16:13] <+krallja> hold on
[May 30 20:16:16] <+Anxiety> works for me
[May 30 20:16:17] <+krallja> i saw another one i liked
[May 30 20:16:17] <@lolcode_com> wait
[May 30 20:16:21] <+krallja> (just for another suggestion)
[May 30 20:16:32] <@Eko> quick pinano ;)_
[May 30 20:16:32] <+Jessicatz> distinguishing between R as var and as keyword is a fiddly bit implementation wise
[May 30 20:16:40] <+krallja> ok ok
[May 30 20:16:42] * krallja is now known as pinano
[May 30 20:16:42] <+pinano> sheesh
[May 30 20:16:46] <@Eko> lol
[May 30 20:17:09] <@Eko> okay, optional LOL has been suggested in #LOLCODE
[May 30 20:17:13] <@Eko> that works for me
[May 30 20:17:17] <+Ihoss> what are we discussing now?
[May 30 20:17:21] <@Eko> assignment
[May 30 20:17:21] <+Jessicatz> optional?
[May 30 20:17:22] <+Jessicatz> hm
[May 30 20:17:24] <@Eko> actually
[May 30 20:17:27] <@Eko> I like mandatory LOL
[May 30 20:17:27] <+Anxiety> LOL a R b IZ c, a = b == c :)
[May 30 20:17:30] <+KrazyJim> I think it should be required
[May 30 20:17:34] <@Eko> it makes it easier to parse the assignment statement
[May 30 20:17:36] <+KrazyJim> makes it a little easier
[May 30 20:17:41] <+pinano> yeah
[May 30 20:17:41] <+Anxiety> Im for mandatory
[May 30 20:17:51] <@Eko> and then you'd know that you are allowed to expand the array to the right size if there is an LOL there
[May 30 20:17:53] <+pinano> the only thing I can think of is decl-assignment
[May 30 20:17:53] <+Jessicatz> I will miss LOL as possible variable name
[May 30 20:18:07] <@Eko> there's always lowercase, Jessicatz
[May 30 20:18:12] <@Eko> and LOLCAT, etc
[May 30 20:18:14] <+pinano> I HAS A HARBL IS 4
[May 30 20:18:21] <+Jessicatz> ITZ
[May 30 20:18:22] <+Anxiety> you can still use it, its quite possible to base keywords on context
[May 30 20:18:23] <+Jessicatz> not IS
[May 30 20:18:27] <+pinano> I HAS A HARBL ITZ* 4
[May 30 20:18:33] <+KrazyJim> how about all keywords being capital, variables being lowercase if they're a reserved keyword
[May 30 20:18:35] <@Eko> pinano, we're not using ITZ in assignment quite yet.
[May 30 20:18:39] <+Jessicatz> KrazyJim: later
[May 30 20:18:43] <@Eko> KrazyJim, later
[May 30 20:18:44] <+Jessicatz> Eko, do the vote

[May 30 20:21:00] <+aarcane> god dagged lag
[May 30 20:21:04] <@Eko> see the topic
[May 30 20:21:09] <@Eko> MORE*
[May 30 20:21:15] <@Eko> conditionals.
[May 30 20:21:30] <+Jessicatz> first if-else?
[May 30 20:21:38] <@Eko> first, I move we vote for IZ <condition> .... whatever ... KTHX
[May 30 20:21:52] <+Ihoss> O IZ var RLY BIGGER THAN var2
[May 30 20:21:56] <@Eko> (mostly the IZ keyword, we already talked about KTHX)
[May 30 20:21:56] <+Ihoss> YA RLY
[May 30 20:22:03] <+KrazyJim> i think IZ <var> <condition O RLY?
[May 30 20:22:04] <+Ihoss> sorry, Eko, didn't see yours :p
[May 30 20:22:19] <@Eko> we're looking at the IZ now ;)
[May 30 20:22:25] <@Eko> notice the ...s.
[May 30 20:22:29] <+Jessicatz> IZ of if, sounds okay
[May 30 20:22:31] <@Eko> any second?
[May 30 20:22:34] <+Ihoss> the problem with that is that it doesn't make sense gramatically
[May 30 20:22:46] <+pinano> >_< lhoss
[May 30 20:22:47] <+Ihoss> O RLY is a question after a statement
[May 30 20:22:47] <@Eko> Ihoss, IZ VAR BIGGER THAN 10
[May 30 20:22:50] <@Eko> works fine
[May 30 20:23:02] <+KrazyJim> lolcats aren't supposed to be gramatically correct
[May 30 20:23:13] <+Ihoss> var IZ BIGGER THAN 10 O RLY?
[May 30 20:23:16] <@lolcode_com> lolcats have a grammar, though.

[May 30 20:24:43] <+Jessicatz> no he can rant here w00t
[May 30 20:24:47] <@Eko> lol
[May 30 20:24:48] <@Eko> indeed.
[May 30 20:24:52] <+SimonRC> Eko: erm, thanks

[May 30 20:25:04] <+SimonRC> Eko: But I'm not a developer
[May 30 20:25:15] <+Jessicatz> I think a THEN construct is fine
[May 30 20:25:15] <@Eko> they motioned for it and nobody said no.
[May 30 20:25:15] <+Anxiety> I think we should revote on IZ as IF
[May 30 20:25:21] <+pinano> I motion that we have a THEN construct
[May 30 20:25:24] <@Eko> Anxiety, why?
[May 30 20:25:25] <+Anxiety> but not until we vote on operators
[May 30 20:25:44] <+Anxiety> how are we going to handle == >= <= != etc

[May 30 20:26:16] <+SimonRC> how about "IZ foo BIGGER THAN bar ?"
[May 30 20:26:18] <+Jessicatz> I like liek
[May 30 20:26:29] <+Anxiety> liek could imply a weaker comparison though
[May 30 20:26:31] <@Eko> I think they should be the capitalized english using BIGGER THAN or SMALLER THAN
[May 30 20:26:33] <+Jessicatz> IZ foo SAME AS bar?
[May 30 20:26:35] <+SimonRC> LIEK is good
[May 30 20:26:35] <+pinano> BIGGER THAN OR EQUAL TO
[May 30 20:26:40] <+Jessicatz> IZ foo LIEK bar
[May 30 20:26:42] <@Eko> and EQUAL TO or NOT EQUAL TO
[May 30 20:26:48] <+Jessicatz> NO TLIEK

[May 30 20:27:39] <@Eko> this is close
[May 30 20:27:42] <@Eko> crap.
[May 30 20:27:43] <+kYx-ng> TIE!
[May 30 20:27:43] <+Jessicatz> head on head
[May 30 20:27:48] <+pinano> haha
[May 30 20:27:51] <+Ihoss> yarr!
[May 30 20:27:58] <@lolcode_com> what are the objections to THEN?
[May 30 20:27:58] <+SimonRC> is there a good way to mis-spell "THEN"?
[May 30 20:28:13] <+Anxiety> I dont think its needed
[May 30 20:28:18] <@Eko> lolcode_com, code readability, and lack of something that makes sense
[May 30 20:28:19] <+SimonRC> it doesn't "fit" with the "IZ"
[May 30 20:28:26] <+Anxiety> and we should come up with the equiv of '{'
[May 30 20:28:32] <+pinano> I think it does fit with IZ
[May 30 20:28:39] <+SimonRC> Anxiety: nah, implicit block-starts are fine
[May 30 20:28:47] <@Eko> yep.
[May 30 20:28:50] <+Anxiety> what if we want a single line?
[May 30 20:28:54] <@Eko> Anxiety, you don't.
[May 30 20:28:54] <+Anxiety> just deal with it?
[May 30 20:28:57] <@Eko> =)
[May 30 20:29:00] <+Anxiety> ok
[May 30 20:29:01] <@Eko> that's another thing
[May 30 20:29:03] <+SimonRC> Anxiety: same-line, like basic?
[May 30 20:29:05] <+pinano> IZ 4 LIEK VAR
[May 30 20:29:05] <+pinano>   YARLY
[May 30 20:29:05] <+pinano>   NOWAI
[May 30 20:29:06] <@lolcode_com> The THEN construct *is* the {
[May 30 20:29:06] <@Eko> your IF is 3 lines if you have one line
[May 30 20:29:15] <+SimonRC> or a "JUST" construct for single-line blocks?
[May 30 20:29:19] <@Eko> it's 4 if you have a then statement
[May 30 20:29:42] <+Anxiety> I dont think we need a YA RLY or NO WAI... NO WAI can be an else
[May 30 20:29:45] <+SimonRC> pinano: aha! YARLY and NOWAI look quite good
[May 30 20:29:52] <@Eko> I think we just need an else
[May 30 20:29:55] <@lolcode_com> You're rejecting IZ VAR BIGGER THAN 10? KTHXBYE then?
[May 30 20:30:14] <+Anxiety> IZ A LIEK B, VISIBLE A, NO WAIT, VISIBLE B, KTHX
[May 30 20:30:19] <+Anxiety> NO WAI*
[May 30 20:30:22] <+Anxiety> , = \n
[May 30 20:30:23] <+Jessicatz> IZ var BIGGER THAN 10? YARLY KTHXBYE
[May 30 20:30:43] <@Eko> so, should it be optional then but allowed?
[May 30 20:30:50] * UnLogikal (n=kyle@c-68-60-80-115.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has left ##lolcode
[May 30 20:30:52] <@Eko> @ YARLY
[May 30 20:30:57] <+Jessicatz> so many things being optionak
[May 30 20:30:59] <+Jessicatz> optional
[May 30 20:31:05] <+pinano> I like optional  ; that's how VB does it
[May 30 20:31:07] <@Eko> actually, there aren't Jessicatz
[May 30 20:31:08] <+SimonRC> Eko: I think, once again, that *should* please everyone
[May 30 20:31:15] <+Jessicatz> yea
[May 30 20:31:20] <+pinano> which is the only thing even remotely close to LOLCODE that I can think of ;)
[May 30 20:31:21] <+Anxiety> before we say yes... we should figure out else-if
[May 30 20:31:26] <+pinano> NOWAI!
[May 30 20:31:33] <+Jessicatz> why not making the entire C dialect optional in LOLCODE =)
[May 30 20:31:33] <@Eko> BUTIZ?
[May 30 20:31:36] <+Ihoss> MEBBE
[May 30 20:31:37] <@lolcode_com> I was always fond of HyperTalk
[May 30 20:31:44] <+Ihoss> lol, BUTIZ
[May 30 20:31:49] <+pinano> oh... elif chaining
[May 30 20:31:49] <+Jessicatz> BUTIZ seems okay
[May 30 20:31:57] <+Jessicatz> MOARLIEK
[May 30 20:32:00] <+pinano> haha
[May 30 20:32:02] <+SimonRC> BUTIZ for "else if" is good, too
[May 30 20:32:11] <@Eko> move to vote to ratify BUTIZ
[May 30 20:32:14] <@lolcode_com> BUT IZ  ftw
[May 30 20:32:19] <+pinano> i move we don't have an else if
[May 30 20:32:22] <+Anxiety> IF A LIEK B\n YA RLY\n VISIBLE A\n OR IZ C LIEK B\n VISIBLE C\n NO WAI\n VISIBLE B\n KTHX
[May 30 20:32:22] <+Jessicatz> IZ var LIEK 10? YARLY ... MOARLIKE ...
[May 30 20:32:24] <+pinano> they're bad programming practice
[May 30 20:32:47] <@Eko> uh
[May 30 20:32:50] <@Eko> how so?
[May 30 20:32:53] <+pinano> if we have to have them, MOARLIEK ftw :P
[May 30 20:32:53] <+Ihoss> not having else if is really clumpsy
[May 30 20:33:00] <+Jessicatz> yea
[May 30 20:33:07] <+Jessicatz> so we have three options now for elseif
[May 30 20:33:09] <@Eko> motion to ratify BUTIZ as else if?
[May 30 20:33:10] <+pinano> you should be using switch() statements if you need more than 2 branches in your conditional :P
[May 30 20:33:11] <+Ihoss> you end up with lots of nested ifs
[May 30 20:33:14] <+Jessicatz> OR LIEK, MOARLIEK and BUTIZ
[May 30 20:33:14] <@Eko> oh
[May 30 20:33:21] <+Anxiety> I think else-if is important, especially if we arent going to have a GOTO
[May 30 20:33:29] <@lolcode_com> these *are* the switch/case statements
[May 30 20:33:32] <+KrazyJim> i think we can do away with elseif and just make people nest if statements if they want it
[May 30 20:33:47] <+Jessicatz> else if is just a else { if() } anyway
[May 30 20:33:48] <@Eko> so, I hear a motion to table ELSEIF for later if we really need it?
[May 30 20:33:49] <@lolcode_com> KrazyJim: also valid
[May 30 20:33:52] <+pinano> wait, these are the cond statements
[May 30 20:33:54] <+pinano> ?
[May 30 20:34:05] <+SimonRC> there is also the possibility of dropping the noral if-then-else, and haveing a LISP-stype COND
[May 30 20:34:08] <@Eko> pinano, yes
[May 30 20:34:16] <+pinano> i mean lisp's cond?
[May 30 20:34:27] <@Eko> what's lisp-stype
[May 30 20:34:28] <+Jessicatz> or ASSERT
[May 30 20:34:32] <@Eko> I can't remember for the life of me
[May 30 20:34:34] <@Eko> Jessicatz, laterz
[May 30 20:34:37] <+SimonRC> *lisp-style
[May 30 20:34:51] <@Eko> no no, what's list-style COND?
[May 30 20:34:57] <+SimonRC> in lisp you have a list of condition+action pairs
[May 30 20:34:59] <+pinano> (COND (condition1 result1) (condition2 result2) (#T defaultresult))
[May 30 20:35:06] <+pinano> (COND (condition1 result1) (condition2 result2)  ....  (#T defaultresult))
[May 30 20:35:08] <+SimonRC> pinano: roughly, yes
[May 30 20:35:19] <+Jessicatz> I propose we need a ELSE for now, seperate ELSE IF-keyword later when needed
[May 30 20:35:24] * pinano is a schemer, sorry for the #T :P
[May 30 20:35:25] <@Eko> second

[May 30 20:39:16] <+kYx-ng> TIE!
[May 30 20:39:19] <+Jessicatz> GAH
[May 30 20:39:20] <+KrazyJim> or is our final going to be split by whitespace
[May 30 20:39:38] <+pinano> i think it meant final
[May 30 20:39:41] <+Anxiety> I think it should all be context based, let the programmer worry about style
[May 30 20:39:42] <@Eko> so far most of us have been assuming that linebreaks are complete statements
[May 30 20:39:44] <@Eko> like a semicolon
[May 30 20:39:46] <+Jessicatz> whitespace clearly should be style and not syntax
[May 30 20:39:53] <+pinano> i think it should be style too
[May 30 20:40:08] <+KrazyJim> in that case we should choose a statement delimiter
[May 30 20:40:10] <@Eko> then I'm glad we made conditionals the only thing with iZ
[May 30 20:40:13] <@lolcode_com> I've rather come around to the idea of significant whitespace
[May 30 20:40:26] <@Eko> I think newlines are the only significant whitepace
[May 30 20:40:30] <@Eko> optionally replaced by a .
[May 30 20:40:32] <+KrazyJim> although I would prefer to put single statements on single lines
[May 30 20:40:34] <+Jessicatz> space is the only significant
[May 30 20:40:38] <+SimonRC> Eko: ah, BASIC-style
[May 30 20:40:39] <+Jessicatz> and imho, it should stay the only one
[May 30 20:40:46] <@Eko> SimonRC, maybe? I dunno
[May 30 20:40:53] <+KrazyJim> I like basic style
[May 30 20:40:54] <+Jessicatz> a DOT, that's nice
[May 30 20:41:16] <+Anxiety> Im fine with a period
[May 30 20:41:20] <+SimonRC> how about other punctuation for statement-seperation?
[May 30 20:41:22] <+Jessicatz> or what about !?
[May 30 20:41:25] <+Jessicatz> I mean !
[May 30 20:41:27] <+pinano> what section of the meeting are we in
[May 30 20:41:30] <@Eko> Jessicatz, that's used for too much
[May 30 20:41:37] <+Jessicatz> okay
[May 30 20:41:43] <@Eko> . isn't used for anything
[May 30 20:41:46] <+Jessicatz> I vote for period than
[May 30 20:41:49] <+Jessicatz> then
[May 30 20:41:49] <@Eko> and isn't required at all if ytou don't want it to be
[May 30 20:42:04] <+pinano> the language is completely parseable without periods or linebreaks, though
[May 30 20:42:05] <+SimonRC> what happens if you use period + newline?
[May 30 20:42:07] <+KrazyJim> I think it should be \n but also allow for .
[May 30 20:42:11] <+Jessicatz> how about making "." and "\n" being replacable?
[May 30 20:42:16] <@Eko> so I motion: !poll 45s Statements are broken up by newlines and/or a period.
[May 30 20:42:19] <+Jessicatz> I mean, substitues
[May 30 20:42:19] <+Anxiety> newline is ignored, just a blank line
[May 30 20:42:27] <+KrazyJim> seconded Eko
[May 30 20:42:32] <+Jessicatz> I don't know eko..
[May 30 20:42:42] <+pinano> i am strongly opposed to this motion
[May 30 20:42:53] <@Eko> pinano?
[May 30 20:42:55] <@lolcode_com> I really don't want extraneous punctuation.
[May 30 20:42:55] <+SimonRC> Eko: surely without statement seperators of any kind, we get the grammar from hell that no human can parse correctly?
[May 30 20:43:03] <+Anxiety> so...   I HAS A VAR1. I HAS A VAR2. or I HAS A VAR1\n I HAS A VAR2\n
[May 30 20:43:11] <+pinano> as lolcode_com says, punctuation is not part of the language
[May 30 20:43:11] <+SimonRC> and syntax-error recovery would be impossible
[May 30 20:43:12] <+Anxiety> like the : in VB
[May 30 20:43:33] <@Eko> pinano, you don't have to use it
[May 30 20:43:37] <+Jessicatz> hum... we need a seperator, that's for sure
[May 30 20:43:39] <+pinano> right, but i have to parse it
[May 30 20:43:41] <@Eko> and it doesn't say that spaces aren't a part of the language
[May 30 20:43:50] <+Jessicatz> I'm fine with "."/"\n"
[May 30 20:43:56] <+Anxiety> I am to
[May 30 20:43:58] <@Eko> pinano, we can just make our NEWLINE token [\n.]
[May 30 20:43:58] <+pinano> i don't like the period
[May 30 20:43:59] <+SimonRC> Black Oroogu has no statement seperators, and every slight misprnt turns the program into one that means something different
[May 30 20:44:18] <@Eko> !poll 45s Statements are broken up by newlines and/or a period.

[May 30 20:47:14] <+Jessicatz> making the ? optional?

[May 30 20:52:38] <+pinano> i changed my mind :P
[May 30 20:52:41] <+Jessicatz> WE ROCKZ
[May 30 20:52:44] <+SimonRC> oh wow, a simple 2-armed conditional now comes in 72 different variations
[May 30 20:52:46] <@Eko> so, we have to do conditionals and add/subtract before we leave? =(
[May 30 20:52:49] <@lolcode_com> hang on, that went too fast.
[May 30 20:53:01] <+Jessicatz> SimonRC: now that's what I call diversity =3
[May 30 20:53:02] <+Anxiety> its easy enough to just ignore things if they exist
[May 30 20:53:29] <+SimonRC> Anxiety: unless the programmer before you used them
[May 30 20:53:35] <@Eko> let's come up with math and comarison real quick
[May 30 20:53:39] <@Eko> howabout use the english versions for now
[May 30 20:53:47] <+Anxiety> I meant for the compiler, SimonRC
[May 30 20:54:05] <+Jessicatz> I agree to eko

[May 30 20:54:43] <@Eko> UP <var>!!<inc> and NERF?
[May 30 20:54:46] <+SimonRC> NERF should be for division
[May 30 20:54:46] <+pinano> UPZ ftw
[May 30 20:54:55] <@Eko> wheee
[May 30 20:55:03] <@Eko> doing operators will take another hour.
[May 30 20:55:07] <+pinano> :P
[May 30 20:55:09] <@Eko> let's do comparison first, shall we?
[May 30 20:55:12] <+Jessicatz> step by step. first addition operatr
[May 30 20:55:17] <+Jessicatz> okay eko.
[May 30 20:55:25] <+pinano> alright
[May 30 20:55:25] <+Jessicatz> I vote for LIEK
[May 30 20:55:25] <@Eko> BIGGER THAN, SMALLER THAN?
[May 30 20:55:49] <@Eko> and LIEKK and NOT LIEK
[May 30 20:55:59] <+Anxiety> do we need the than?    IZ A BIGGER B.... I guess we do
[May 30 20:56:00] <@Eko> with only one K
[May 30 20:56:19] <@Eko> any other suggestions?
[May 30 20:56:24] <+Jessicatz> "BIGGER" = ">"
[May 30 20:56:28] <@lolcode_com> hey, can I cut in with a quick site admin note?
[May 30 20:56:32] <+pinano> there are 6 comparison operators
[May 30 20:56:37] <@Eko> lolcode_com, go ahead
[May 30 20:56:42] <@Eko> oh right pinano crap.
[May 30 20:56:49] <@Eko> howabout
[May 30 20:56:54] <@Eko> NOT BIGGER THAN = <=
[May 30 20:56:56] <+Anxiety> > < == != >= <=
[May 30 20:57:04] <+Jessicatz> Eko: that's wrong
[May 30 20:57:14] <+KrazyJim> >= is !< though
[May 30 20:57:14] <@Eko> damn, you're right.
[May 30 20:57:15] <+Jessicatz> that would imply !(a > b)
[May 30 20:57:19] <@Eko> er
[May 30 20:57:19] <@lolcode_com> can you decide amongst yourselves about a half dozen folks to be upped to contributor privs on the wiki?
[May 30 20:57:23] <@Eko> no, I was right
[May 30 20:57:27] <+Jessicatz> yea
[May 30 20:57:29] <@lolcode_com> not necessarily tonight, but soon.
[May 30 20:57:29] <+Jessicatz> m fault
[May 30 20:57:37] <+pinano> i'd like one :o3
[May 30 20:57:40] <+SimonRC> how about "BIGR" and "SMALR", or something similar?
[May 30 20:57:44] * lolcode_com is very tired.
[May 30 20:57:51] <+pinano> i like it, SimonRC
[May 30 20:57:55] <+Anxiety> IZ A NOT BIGGER THAN B = if( a <= b ) ?
[May 30 20:57:55] <@Eko> me to
[May 30 20:58:00] <@Eko> BIGR THAN
[May 30 20:58:03] <@Eko> SMALR THAN
[May 30 20:58:04] <@Eko> ?
[May 30 20:58:08] <+Jessicatz> why the THAN
[May 30 20:58:10] <@lolcode_com> anyway, someone email me.
[May 30 20:58:14] <@Eko> reads more easily?
[May 30 20:58:22] <+pinano> ok but it should be
[May 30 20:58:28] <+Anxiety> yeah, it feels awkward without it
[May 30 20:58:31] <@Eko> >_< optional than?
[May 30 20:58:32] <+Jessicatz> hm okay
[May 30 20:58:35] <+Jessicatz> no not again
[May 30 20:58:36] <+pinano> n/m
[May 30 20:58:39] <+Anxiety> optional is fine with me
[May 30 20:58:45] <+pinano> haha
[May 30 20:58:45] <+Jessicatz> there NEEDS to be some strict rules there
[May 30 20:58:53] <+KrazyJim> i agree with Jessicatz
[May 30 20:58:55] <@Eko> i'm all for not optional.
[May 30 20:59:02] <+KrazyJim> i think than should me mandatory
[May 30 20:59:05] <+pinano> SAEM
[May 30 20:59:07] <@lolcode_com> KTHXBYE
[May 30 20:59:07] <+Jessicatz> or else we could make writing C code in LOLCATS "optional"
[May 30 20:59:21] <@Eko> [NOT] ((BIGR|SMALR) THAN|EQUAL TO)
[May 30 20:59:22] <+Jessicatz> LOLCODE, dammit
[May 30 20:59:24] <+pinano> agree with Jessicatz
[May 30 20:59:32] <+pinano> EQUAL TO = SAEM
[May 30 20:59:35] * lolcode_com has quit ("Leaving")
[May 30 20:59:36] <@Eko> oh
[May 30 20:59:37] <@Eko> oops
[May 30 20:59:38] <+SimonRC> or LIEK
[May 30 20:59:42] <@Eko> [NOT] ((BIGR|SMALR) THAN|LIEK)
[May 30 20:59:43] <+Jessicatz> I like LIEK

[May 30 21:00:12] <@Eko> what about AND and OR
[May 30 21:00:17] <@Eko> =)
[May 30 21:00:24] <+SimonRC> AN    OR
[May 30 21:00:24] <+pinano> those aren't comparison operators :P
[May 30 21:00:31] <@Eko> true.
[May 30 21:00:32] <+pinano> are they bitwise or boolean ;P
[May 30 21:00:33] <@Eko> they're boolean.
[May 30 21:00:43] <+Anxiety> <var> [NOT] (BIGR THAN|SMALR THAN|LIEK) <var> [AND *]
[May 30 21:00:45] <+pinano> how do you do bitwise
[May 30 21:00:51] <+Anxiety> <var> [NOT] (BIGR THAN|SMALR THAN|LIEK) <var> [(AND|OR) *]
[May 30 21:00:51] <+SimonRC> BASIC manages just fine with a single set of comparison ops
[May 30 21:01:03] <+pinano> unless you have to do something bitwise ;)
[May 30 21:01:08] <+pinano> OH right

[May 30 21:02:01] <+Jessicatz> mandatory
[May 30 21:02:04] <+pinano> mandatory

[May 30 21:06:40] <+kYx-ng> The yeas win by a landslide!
[May 30 21:06:47] <@Eko> okay, you guys come up with +/-*
[May 30 21:06:52] <+pinano> Value of false and true
[May 30 21:06:54] <+Anxiety> ADDZ, MINUZ, TIMEZ, DIVZ, UPZ, NURFZ
[May 30 21:07:07] <+pinano> UPZ is ++?
[May 30 21:07:07] <+Anxiety> TRUTHS, LIES
[May 30 21:07:09] <+pinano> or +=?
[May 30 21:07:11] <+Anxiety> ++
[May 30 21:07:14] <+SimonRC> I would do UPZ and NERFZ for + and -
[May 30 21:07:18] <+Anxiety> NUFZ = --
[May 30 21:07:23] <+Jessicatz> NERFZ
[May 30 21:07:27] <+SimonRC> nah, we don't want to imitate C
[May 30 21:07:37] <+Jessicatz> true
[May 30 21:07:39] <@Eko> I liked UP <var>!!<inc>
[May 30 21:07:40] <+pinano> there are several code examples with UPZ
[May 30 21:07:49] <@Eko> it's used all over the place
[May 30 21:07:50] <+aarcane> me too
[May 30 21:07:53] <+pinano> or UP <var>!!<expression.int>
[May 30 21:08:01] <+SimonRC> unless, NURFZ is both the decrement statement *and* the addition operator
[May 30 21:08:02] <+Jessicatz> yea I like UP
[May 30 21:08:02] <+Anxiety> UPZ <var>[!!<inv>]
[May 30 21:08:06] <+SimonRC> that shouldn;t be ambiguous
[May 30 21:08:06] <+aarcane> UP penis_inches!!-1
[May 30 21:08:20] <+aarcane> for subtraction
[May 30 21:08:22] <+pinano> right
[May 30 21:08:26] <+pinano> how do you do non-destructive addition though
[May 30 21:08:31] <+Anxiety> NERFZ penis
[May 30 21:08:37] <+pinano> LOL val = A PLUS B
[May 30 21:08:40] <+Anxiety> sounds more funny
[May 30 21:08:41] <+pinano> LOL val R A PLUS B
[May 30 21:08:48] <@Eko> A UP 5 = a + 5, UPZ A[!!<increment>] = a+=<inc>?
[May 30 21:08:55] <@Eko> let's do addition-type operators first
[May 30 21:09:06] <+Jessicatz> Eko, that's nice
[May 30 21:09:18] <+Jessicatz> UP for +
[May 30 21:09:19] <+Anxiety> PLUZ, MINUZ, TIMEZ, BYZ... A PLUZ B, A MINUZ B, A TIMEZ B, A BYZ B
[May 30 21:09:25] <+SimonRC> If you forbid putting assignments in the middle of expressions, then making += and + the smae is quite sensible, surely?
[May 30 21:09:35] <+Jessicatz> UPZ for +=
[May 30 21:09:41] <+SimonRC> Jessicatz: hmm

[May 30 21:32:24] <+Jessicatz> use a real language :P
[May 30 21:32:29] <+Anxiety> lol
[May 30 21:32:35] <+Jessicatz> j/k
[May 30 21:32:48] <+Anxiety> I have a C script and VBScript parser/compiler written in C++

[May 30 21:36:55] <+SimonRC> when is the next meeting?
[May 30 21:37:10] <+Jessicatz> what is DIAF?
[May 30 21:37:19] <@Eko> exit with an error condition.
[May 30 21:37:21] <@Eko> i.e. die in a fire.
[May 30 21:38:18] <+Jessicatz> okay
[May 30 21:38:19] <@Eko> we need to get this on the wiki
[May 30 21:38:26] <+Jessicatz> nice canon
[May 30 21:38:30] <+Anxiety> http://rafb.net/p/w6iGP187.html
[May 30 21:38:36] <+SimonRC> how wide are integers?
[May 30 21:38:47] <@Eko> 32 bit minimum?
[May 30 21:39:05] <+SimonRC> the spec doesn't say, so I assume they should literally be integers, i.e. unlimited size
[May 30 21:39:27] <@Eko> yeah, there's a lot that the spec doesn't say
[May 30 21:39:30] <@Eko> but this is mostly minutes
[May 30 21:39:38] <@Eko> that stuff can be fleshed out on the wiki pages
[May 30 21:40:10] <+Jessicatz> in my interpreter they ar long ints atm
[May 30 21:40:14] <Arachnid> Do what BF did - make it implementation dependent. :P
[May 30 21:40:14] <Arachnid> For that matter, C does that too
[May 30 21:40:26] <@Eko> lol
[May 30 21:40:31] <@Eko> i'd say 32bit minimum.
[May 30 21:40:34] <Arachnid> What's "LOL <var> R <var>"? Assignment?
[May 30 21:40:37] <+SimonRC> I prefer the Haskell-extending style: someone comes up with the perfect design of a feature, adds the perferct implementation to GHC, then it gets treated as standard
[May 30 21:40:42] <+SimonRC> Arachnid: yes
[May 30 21:40:43] <@Eko> Arachnid, <var> = <val>
[May 30 21:41:07] <+KrazyJim> I'd like a forum if we can get one before next meeting, were any arrangements made?
[May 30 21:41:09] <+pinano> LOL <var> R <expression>
[May 30 21:41:17] <+pinano> sets var to expression value
[May 30 21:41:37] <+SimonRC> when is the next meeting BTW?
[May 30 21:41:42] <@Eko> not set yet.
[May 30 21:41:45] <+SimonRC> ok
[May 30 21:41:45] <Arachnid> Hm. The "IZ" operator always requires a block now?
[May 30 21:41:55] <+pinano> it requires a closing KTHX
[May 30 21:42:05] <Arachnid> I think I preferred the "IZ <cond>? <statement>" singular form
[May 30 21:42:09] <+Anxiety> [SOMETHING] implies its optional
[May 30 21:42:22] <@Eko> Arachnid, who's preferred?
[May 30 21:42:33] <@Eko> on the wiki it was blocked almost exclusively
[May 30 21:42:36] <Arachnid> My coco/r parser handles both
[May 30 21:42:41] <Arachnid> Eko: One of the front-page examples has it
[May 30 21:43:08] <+SimonRC> zzzzzz
[May 30 21:43:30] <@Eko> Arachnid, the ones on the front page don't even mesh with the ones in the keywords section, lol
[May 30 21:43:40] <Arachnid> Well, apart from the 'everything is an array' bit, looks manageable for compiling to the CLR :)
[May 30 21:43:54] <+pinano> hooray CLR
[May 30 21:43:56] <Arachnid> Eko: Yeah, I was trying to parse everything that seemed to be 'canon' - the front page and anything linked from it
[May 30 21:44:01] <+Anxiety> LOLCODE.NET ?
[May 30 21:44:14] <+pinano> it's dot com!
[May 30 21:44:16] <@Eko> .com?
[May 30 21:44:24] <@Eko> Arachnid, hence what this meeting was for.
[May 30 21:44:31] <+Anxiety> .NET as in CLR
[May 30 21:44:31] <@Eko> the site contradicted itself more than it agreed
[May 30 21:44:33] <Arachnid> aye
[May 30 21:44:46] <+pinano> haha
[May 30 21:44:50] <+pinano> LOLCODE#
[May 30 21:44:51] <Arachnid> Anxiety: that's what I'm working on
[May 30 21:44:57] <@Eko> I Know pinano >_<
[May 30 21:45:11] <@Eko> pinano, what I pasted are the minutes
[May 30 21:45:12] <+pinano> LOLCODE++ adds objects and static typing >_<
[May 30 21:45:13] <Arachnid> Is "CAN HAS" C style source file inclusion, or C#/Java style namespace inclusion?
[May 30 21:45:19] <@Eko> lol pinano
[May 30 21:45:26] <+pinano> Eko: where did you paste
[May 30 21:45:29] <+Anxiety> I vote namespace
[May 30 21:45:32] <@Eko> uh
[May 30 21:45:35] <@Eko> your vote didn't count.
[May 30 21:45:37] <@Eko> file/module
[May 30 21:45:43] <+Jessicatz> its source file inclusion
[May 30 21:45:51] <Arachnid> Damn. Sucks.
[May 30 21:45:56] <+Anxiety> seriously
[May 30 21:46:03] <+pinano> what happened to CAN HAS STDIO?
[May 30 21:46:04] <+Jessicatz> I'm looking forward to scoping votes
[May 30 21:46:06] <Arachnid> I guess LOLCode.net won't be able to import the rest of the CLR to use. :P
[May 30 21:46:17] <+pinano> god i hope not
[May 30 21:46:17] <+pinano> :P
[May 30 21:46:57] <+Jessicatz> atm lolcode only has global scope
[May 30 21:46:59] <Arachnid> Hm. No gotos and no functions - is this turing ocmplete yet? :)
[May 30 21:47:06] <@Eko> pinano, notes: http://rafb.net/p/Jg4UGJ95.html
[May 30 21:47:07] <+pinano> Arachnid: use loops :P
[May 30 21:47:08] <+Jessicatz> they are going to come
[May 30 21:47:13] * odious (n=odious@203-166-240-208.dyn.iinet.net.au) has joined ##lolcode
[May 30 21:47:16] <Arachnid> pinano: No way to escape a loop, either
[May 30 21:47:19] * Anxiety takes off
[May 30 21:47:23] <@Eko> Arachnid, wrong
[May 30 21:47:27] <+pinano> i thought KTHXBYE escaped loop
[May 30 21:47:35] <@Eko> pinano, KTHXBYE only matches a HAI
[May 30 21:47:39] <+Jessicatz> Arachnid: first meeting, we only did the basics yet
[May 30 21:47:42] <+pinano> awe
[May 30 21:47:45] <@Eko> oh shoot
[May 30 21:47:49] <Arachnid> according to canon, "KTHXBYE only closes HAI and exits with good condition"
[May 30 21:47:52] <@Eko> where did the loop break and continue to.
[May 30 21:48:02] <Arachnid> Jessicatz: I think turing completeness is pretty basic ;)
[May 30 21:48:39] <+Jessicatz> input/output, control flow
[May 30 21:48:42] <+Jessicatz> that's turing complete :P
[May 30 21:49:01] <@Eko> GTFO is break.
[May 30 21:49:10] <Arachnid> Without being able to break out of a loop, the control flow isn't sufficient. And turing completeness doesn't even require IO. :P
[May 30 21:49:17] <+pinano> that's not canon, Eko
[May 30 21:49:18] <+pinano> :p
[May 30 21:49:34] <@Eko> pinano, it was voted upon
[May 30 21:49:35] <@Eko> I missed it
[May 30 21:49:38] <+pinano> ok
[May 30 21:49:43] <Arachnid> Is there a 'continue'?
[May 30 21:49:46] <+Jessicatz> yes
[May 30 21:49:46] <@Eko> not yet.
[May 30 21:49:48] <@Eko> oh
[May 30 21:49:49] <@Eko> is there?
[May 30 21:49:53] <@Eko> that we voted on?
[May 30 21:49:54] <+Jessicatz> the wiki has one
[May 30 21:49:57] <@Eko> =P
[May 30 21:49:59] <+Jessicatz> no, we didn't vote on that
[May 30 21:50:01] <@Eko> we didn't vote on one.
[May 30 21:50:10] <+pinano> ok
[May 30 21:50:15] <+pinano> sounds like you guys have this under control
[May 30 21:50:17] <Arachnid> As a last minute thing, having a way to get the length of an array seems pretty essential
[May 30 21:50:18] <@Eko> we need one though, but I guess that'll have to come later
[May 30 21:50:23] <Arachnid> But I guess that will have to wait too
[May 30 21:50:27] <@Eko> hahahahahaha
[May 30 21:50:28] <+pinano> more under control than TXT ME A and the other crap on the wiki
[May 30 21:50:29] <@Eko> yes
[May 30 21:50:30] <@Eko> that would be good.
[May 30 21:50:41] <+Jessicatz> lol that are just functions
[May 30 21:50:45] * Arachnid sees some annoying lookahead resolution things to sort out
[May 30 21:51:06] <+Jessicatz> Arachnid: you ARE the annoying lookahead resoltuon
[May 30 21:51:10] <+Jessicatz> resolution
[May 30 21:51:15] <+pinano> kbye all
[May 30 21:51:16] <+Jessicatz> :P
[May 30 21:51:18] <Arachnid> Like distinguishing "[## IN MAH] <var>" from just a number
[May 30 21:51:37] <+pinano> :3

[May 30 21:51:42] <Arachnid> Jessicatz: If that made any sense, I'd be hurt ;)
[May 30 21:51:58] <+Jessicatz> no it didn't make any sense
[May 30 21:52:12] <+KrazyJim> multidimensional arrays will add some spice to parsing it too
[May 30 21:52:23] <+Jessicatz> oh yea
[May 30 21:52:26] <+Jessicatz> that will be fun
[May 30 21:52:43] <Arachnid> Well, since 'CANON' doesn't say anything about that...
[May 30 21:52:55] <@Eko> =P
[May 30 21:52:57] <+Jessicatz> do you even get the point?
[May 30 21:52:57] <@Eko> it's better than it was.
[May 30 21:52:57] <Arachnid> I'm going to assume that you have to simply fetch it one dimension at a time. :P
[May 30 21:53:01] <@Eko> of course it's not perfect.
[May 30 21:53:10] <+Jessicatz> its a note, nothing more
[May 30 21:53:24] <Arachnid> Yeah, this beats what I was working from last night by a long shot :)
[May 30 21:53:59] <+Jessicatz> hm what do I do now
[May 30 21:54:19] <+KrazyJim> mm, I sat down to work on it, implemented a few keywords from the main page then after looking at the contributions realised going any further would probably make some code redundant
[May 30 21:55:04] <+Anxiety> look at it as prototyping
[May 30 21:55:48] <@Eko> can has must also have a ? at the end
[May 30 21:55:52] <Arachnid> Actually, it gets worse than just multidimensional arrays
[May 30 21:56:10] <Arachnid> "foo IN MAH var", then "fob IN MAH foo IN MAH bar"
[May 30 21:56:15] <Arachnid> bar[foo[fob]]
[May 30 21:56:30] <Arachnid> Fun. :P
[May 30 21:56:35] <@Eko> Arachnid, baically, lol
[May 30 21:57:34] <@Eko> http://lolcode.com/keywords/can-has
[May 30 21:57:37] <@Eko> thats' the format I'm going to use
[May 30 21:57:39] <@Eko> look good?
[May 30 21:58:04] <Arachnid> Looks good to me
[May 30 21:58:07] <+Jessicatz> yea
[May 30 21:58:16] <Arachnid> Are you going to build an index of pages that are 'standard'?
[May 30 21:58:24] <+Jessicatz> I hope so
[May 30 21:59:00] <+KrazyJim> also, is BTW going to be used as a comment
[May 30 21:59:10] <+Jessicatz> yes it is
[May 30 21:59:10] <+KrazyJim> (not that it really matters since changing the keyword is easy)
[May 30 22:00:16] <Arachnid> How do you open a file?
[May 30 22:00:27] <+KrazyJim> currently, you don't
[May 30 22:00:29] <Arachnid> The canon has how to read from a file, but not how to open or close it
[May 30 22:00:33] <Arachnid> Ah, so stdio only?
[May 30 22:00:52] <+KrazyJim> yup
[May 30 22:01:27] <@Eko> yeah, BTW is kindof a de-facto comment
[May 30 22:01:28] * Jessicatz has quit ()
[May 30 22:01:43] <@Eko> I'm going to include it in the spec, but still as pre-v1.0
[May 30 22:02:01] <@Eko> and anything under Keywords is considered the "official" spec i think
[May 30 22:02:13] <@Eko> the contributions are suggestions.
[May 30 22:02:20] <Arachnid> cool
